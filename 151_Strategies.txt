Abstract
We provide detailed descriptions, including over 550 mathematical formulas, for over 150 trading strategies across a host of asset classes (and trading
styles). This includes stocks, options, fixed income, futures, ETFs, indexes,
commodities, foreign exchange, convertibles, structured assets, volatility (as
an asset class), real estate, distressed assets, cash, cryptocurrencies, miscellany (such as weather, energy, inflation), global macro, infrastructure, and tax
arbitrage. Some strategies are based on machine learning algorithms (such as
artificial neural networks, Bayes, k-nearest neighbors). We also give: source
code for illustrating out-of-sample backtesting with explanatory notes; around
2,000 bibliographic references; and over 900 glossary, acronym and math definitions. The presentation is intended to be descriptive and pedagogical.

“If you want to work as a trader or quant on Wall Street, you have to walk the
walk and talk the talk. This unique book is a comprehensive introduction to a wide
variety of tried and tested trading strategies. I highly recommend a 152nd trading
strategy called buy this book!”
–Peter Carr, Professor and Chair of Finance and Risk Engineering Department, NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering; and 2010 Financial Engineer of the
Year, International Association for Quantitative Finance & Sungard
“This book is an encyclopedic guided tour of “quant” investment strategies, from
the simplest ones (like trend following) to much more exotic ones using sophisticated
derivative contracts. No claim is made about the profitability of these strategies: one
knows all too well how much implementation details and transaction costs matter.
But no quant trader can afford ignoring what’s out there, as a source of inspiration
or as a benchmark for new ideas.”
–Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Chairman and Chief Scientist, Capital Fund Management; Professor, Ecole Normale Sup´erieure; Member, French Academy of Sci- ´
ences; and Co-Director, CFM-Imperial Institute of Quantitative Finance
“Zura Kakushadze and Juan Andr´es Serur have created a masterful encyclopedia
of quantitative trading strategies. The authors offer us a rigorous but accessible
treatment of the mathematical foundations of these strategies. The coverage is
comprehensive, starting with simple and well-known strategies such as covered call
and then moving naturally to strategies involving cryptocurrencies. The supporting
material such as a detailed glossary and an extensive list of references will make this
book an essential reference for financial economists and investment professionals.”
–Hossein Kazemi, Michael & Cheryl Philipp Endowed Professor of Finance,
University of Massachusetts at Amherst; and Editor-in-Chief, The Journal of Alternative Investments
“The successful trading of financial instruments is both a science and an art, just as
the efforts of a chef reflect both gastronomic artistry and the underlying chemical
and thermal processes of cooking. In 151 Trading Strategies financial traders are
provided with a compendium of sound recipes, spanning the broad range of methods that can be applied to modern investment practice. The exposition of both the
mathematics and intuition of each described trade is clear and concise. Readers will
appreciate the inclusion of extensive computer code so as to reduce effort needed to
implement any required calculations.”
–Dan diBartolomeo, President, Northfield Information Services; and Editor,
Journal of Asset Management

covering of popular hedge fund strategies. By revealing all the hedge funds’ secret

to lower ’em fees!”
–Jim Kyung-Soo Liew, Assistant Professor of Finance, Carey Business School,
Johns Hopkins University; Advisory Board Member, The Journal of Portfolio Management; and Co-Founder, SoKat
“This book is an impressive concentration of strategies and formulas to expand
knowledge in quantitative finance; it’s a must-read for anyone who wants to drastically improve his or her expertise in financial markets dynamics.”

Preface (by Zura Kakushadze)
The purpose of this “post-factum” Preface is to give some history, which sheds light
on why we (the authors) have decided to make this book, which has been published
in hardcover (and as an e-book),4
into a freely downloadable PDF e-book on SSRN.
In December of 2015 I posted the paper “101 Formulaic Alphas” on SSRN
[Kakushadze, 2016], which provides explicit formulas (that are also computer source
code) for 101 real-life formulaic quantitative trading alphas. That paper was a hit
– in hindsight, perhaps unsurprisingly, considering how secretive quant trading is.
So, at some point down the road, a light bulb went on in my head and I got this
seemingly “crazy” idea to write a paper entitled “101 Trading Strategies”, except
that this time these 101 strategies would be spread across all asset classes (as opposed
to equities (StatArb) quant trading alphas as in “101 Formulaic Alphas”). I did not
envision this as a book, just as a paper, maybe 100+ pages long, 1 page per strategy
on average, plus overhead (introduction, references, etc.), something publishable in
a journal (at least online). I also thought it would be both fun and efficient to get
around 10-12 coauthors together, each would contribute about 10 strategies in one
or two asset classes according to their fields of expertise, so the project would go
faster. So, I pinged my contacts by email and posted several posts in the LinkedIn
feed and groups saying that I was looking for collaborators for this project. I got a
rather decent number of responses, some evidently were not serious, but some were.
However, once I outlined in more detail what I had in mind for this project – I
had a written plan – apparently people realized that this would not be a cakewalk,
and most disappeared. As it turned out, the only person who was truly serious
about this project was Juan Andr´es Serur, a young professor from Buenos Aires,
Argentina, whom I had never even met in person. There were a lot of challenges
along the way (including that Juan had never worked on a project of this magnitude
and was learning on the job, so to speak). But at the end we got through it. Except
that we did not have just 100+ pages with 101 strategies but over 350 pages with
around 160-170 strategies (depending on how one counts). This was not publishable
in any journal, by any stretch. This project basically had taken on a life of its own
and turned into... a book. So, we discussed it and decided to publish it as such.
Publishing a quant trading/finance book such as “151 Trading Strategies” is not
a very rewarding business (at least financially), for several reasons. First, the target
audience is rather limited because of the highly technical nature of the material.
In my original exploratory call with them, the publisher mentioned that books like
this sell around 1,000 copies total. This was consistent with what I was told by
someone who is well-known in the field and had published 5 quant trading/finance
books over the years, which had sold around 5,000 copies altogether. Second, if the
book is published by a major publisher, the authors get dismal royalties, usually
in the 8-12% range, which can go to around 20% if the book sells better than

expected. At $60-$70 for a hardcover, your book has to sell 100,000+ copies for
you to make any decent money so it is a least somewhat commensurate with the
time you spend on writing the book – this book took about 9 months to write,
not including the time I spent on it before drafting started (conceiving it, looking
for coauthors, etc.) or the time spent dealing with the publisher, advertising it,
etc. Third, this particular publisher does not publish paperbacks as a matter of
some policy I do not comprehend, and when the price is set around $60-$70 for
a hardcover, the pool of potential buyers is dramatically reduced compared with
a $20-$30 price point a paperback would have. Fourth, there are plenty of people
working in quant trading/finance who can easily afford $60-$70, but many of these
people – not to offend anyone – would rather download a pirated PDF copy from the
internet... Fifth, the publisher’s business model appears to be immune to the fact
that they cannot make much money from hardcover sales. Instead, their business
model appears to hinge on e-book downloads through their existing (institutional)
subscriptions: a subscriber, who pays a subscription fee, can freely download any
book from the publisher’s portfolio. So, the success of a book is measured by e-book
downloads by subscribers, not by hardcover sales, and the authors do not get paid
per download, they only get paid a very symbolic (mildly put) flat fee irrespective
of the number of such downloads. The bottom line is that there is no money to be
made in this business for the authors. We were well-aware of this from the get-go.
We did not publish this book for money – originally, it was going to be a paper.
What is worse though is that, unlike in the olden days when editors would read
every word of your manuscript and mark it up so it could be improved, etc., nowadays
there appears to be little to no editorial support. We wrote the manuscript in LaTeX
(as there are over 550 elevated equations in the book, not counting inline math), we
created the index ourselves (which is a major pain and very time-consuming, if done
right; in fact, it is probably the single worst part of writing a book), and proofread
the manuscript several times to the point where upon the final proofreading right
before printing we found only 5 minor typos attributable to our original manuscript.
The bottom line is that we spent a lot of time perfecting our manuscript and it was
very much print-ready. However, things got really messy on the publisher’s end.
The nightmare started with the book cover. The publisher ask me if I had any
concrete ideas for how I wanted the cover designed, and if I had a specific cover
image in mind and to feel free to send along some images from Getty and Alamy
(the image providers the publisher uses). I was taken aback. They keep almost
all the profits and they ask me for the cover design? If we have to design our
own cover, then we might as self-well publish and keep most royalties. I told them
to design the cover professionally, as this was their responsibility. Their so-called
“designs” they forwarded were highly unimpressive (just really super-minimalist –
mildly put). So, I ended up designing the cover myself, including picking the cover
image from the library of thousands of available images, placing the title and author
names on the cover, etc. Their “design team” used my cover design and the only
“substantial” change they made was changing the color of the title fonts to (in my
11

humble opinion) suboptimal white – the publisher said they could not accommodate
the color I suggested. So, imagine how appalled and taken aback I was when in the
ready-to-publish final book version, on the copyright page, they put some name for
the cover design credit, and did not even mention mine. They said the cover design
“is theirs”, apparently referring to their “design team”. This was just factually false.
But we did not wish to appear “difficult” or “unaccommodating”, so we let this go.
However, the nightmare continued with author biographies on an inside flap of
the dust jacket. They asked us to provide our headshots. We did. At least three
times they produced the author biographies with one of the headshots sizably larger
than the other, even though we provided identically sized headshots. Worse yet,
they claimed that the headshots on the dust jacket were the same size when they
clearly were not. So, again, not to appear “difficult” or “unaccommodating”, having
wasted an inordinate amount of time on this, we let them leave our headshots out of
the inside flap as their “design team” either could not or would not get them right.
Little did we know that this was only the tip of the iceberg. When we finally
(and belatedly) received the proofs from the publisher, we found over 100 typos
introduced by the publisher’s typesetters in most incomprehensible ways. Worse yet,
the one inadvertent grammar typo we did have in our original manuscript (along
with four other, more subtle, non-grammar typos) was not fixed. It was painfully
evident that they did not proofread the manuscript very carefully – them creating
100+ unfathomable typos speaks volumes. So, we spent countless additional hours
fixing their typos, and it took more than one round of revisions for them to get it
right. In hindsight, this should come as no surprise: as many other publishers, they
apparently outsource typesetting, copyediting, cover design, etc., to a developing
country, and I highly doubt that, e.g., the English proficiency on the other end of
this outsourcing process is top-notch. It is the all-familiar and prevalent sad story:
English-language books are produced by people whose first language is not English.
Finally, the book was online. However, the nightmare continued. There is an
appendix in the book with computer source code and a lengthy discussion. This
appendix was just another chapter in the book and was not supposed to be a part
of the free preview of the book, which we expressly discussed and agreed on with
the publisher in writing to be limited to the first two chapters. Yet, they included
the appendix in the back matter of the book, which is freely downloadable from
the publisher’s website along with the front matter. When I pointed this out to the
publisher, their reply was that, for them to redo the files, it would delay the release of
the book accordingly (and, based on prior history, that meant weeks, if not longer).
This was already after multiple delays on the publisher’s end. So, once again, not to
appear “difficult” or “unaccommodating”, we let this go and the appendix stayed
in the freely-downloadable back matter. Speaking of which, while in our original
manuscript all references were in one place, at the end, in the published version the
references were cited at the end of each chapter. However, the publisher – for the
reasons we do not comprehend – also kept the full list of references in the freelydownloadable back matter. While in the modular (where all chapters, front matter

and back matter have separate PDF files) electronic e-book version this is not a big
deal, they actually also included these duplicate references in the back matter in the
printed version, which substantially (and artificially) increased its number of pages.
But there is more. One would imagine that their production team would do some
basic quality control post-production. Months later we found out that the Kindle
version on Amazon was all messed up, with equations not displaying properly, etc.
The publisher claimed that they provided correct files to Amazon and that the
problem was on Amazon’s end. It took them several weeks to fix this issue, and
the fix was a “hack”: they replaced the Kindle version with the so-called “replica”
version, which is just a replica of the PDF. Anyone can easily create a “replica”
version from a PDF using Kindle Create – this does not take a leading publisher.
Furthermore, the Kindle preview version displays material substantially outside of
the preview material we agreed on. But then again, who cares about the authors?
Nor did the publisher seem to care much about the apparent pirated versions
of the book PDF appearing on various websites. Basically, it was unclear what, if
anything, the publisher was doing for the book. Their entire marketing effort was
apparently limited to whopping two tweets they sent when the book was published.
Essentially all the marketing efforts came from me promoting the book on LinkedIn
(where I have over quarter million followers) by posting links to the preview version
then-available on SSRN and the full version/hardcover on the publisher’s websites.
Perhaps most unfathomably, not only did the publisher apparently did not do
much to protect the book from pirated copies being available on the internet, or
to promote the book, they outright refused to refute a factually false and defamatory “review” an anonymous purchaser placed on Amazon. E.g., that review falsely
claims that “there is only a tiny paragraph (no more than 10 lines), very general,
on each strategy and then close to 10 pages of book references after each strategy.”
This is factually false: there are not “10 pages of book references after each strategy”. There are references after each chapter (not strategy or section) pursuant
to the publisher’s own formatting (see above). The review also falsely claims that
“A 10 line description of a very general strategy, no math, no backrest, no optimization.” Again, this is factually false: as the reader can readily see, the book
has over 550 elevated equations (not counting lots of math embedded in the text),
the source code for backtesting in Appendix A, strategies involving optimization,
900+ glossary terms, acronyms and math definitions, etc. Furthermore, simpler
strategies have concise (but precise) descriptions, while others span pages, not “10
lines”, contrary to what the review falsely claims. The review also complains about
the number of references in the book. The book description on Amazon (as well as
the publisher’s websites) expressly states that there are around 2,000 bibliographic
references in the book, one of whose aims is to serve as a reference guide into (and
essentially an encyclopedia of) trading strategies (which is also stated in the Editorial Reviews of the book). Therefore, the anonymous reviewer was well aware of
this before purchasing the book. The review further falsely claims: “And then, as
if it were not enough, at the end of the book the author recaps all the references

one more time.” The review is expressly attacking “the author” of the book, even
though, as mentioned above, the specific formatting of the references (whereby the
references pertinent to each chapter are included after each chapter, and all references are also included in the back matter, which is freely downloadable from the
publisher’s website) was performed by the publisher, not by the authors. Our original manuscript has references only at the end. Again, as mentioned above, why the
publisher duplicated the references both after the chapters and in the back matter
is not something we understand, and it is not something we did or had control over,
contrary to the anonymous reviewer’s factually false and defamatory statements.
When we discovered the aforesaid factually false and defamatory review on Amazon, we contacted the publisher and asked them, at the minimum to put a comment
on the review refuting its factually false statements, and also to contact Amazon to
remove the review (as under Amazon’s policies, defamatory reviews are not allowed).
To our bewilderment, the publisher suggested that we use our contacts to generate
positive reviews on Amazon to counteract that negative review. Incredible, isn’t it?
To be clear, having over a quarter million followers on LinkedIn and putting lots
of content out there on social media, I have had my share of haters. And one thing
I have learned is that there is some truth to the common expression “haters make
us famous”. When you write a paper or a book or anything else you stick your neck
out with, it comes with the territory: some will love it, some will hate it, and some
will not care. I write things for the “some-will-love-it” demographic and I do not
care about the rest. However, there is a big difference between someone expressing
a negative opinion about what you have written – this is perfectly acceptable, we
live in a free country with freedom of speech – and someone making factually false
and defamatory statements, which is not acceptable. And when you write a book
and grant the publisher all kinds of rights for the book, it falls onto the publisher to
protect its integrity and reputation, as the publisher owns the rights to the book.
There is a lesson to be learned from all this. That a large publisher will do
little to nothing to protect the integrity and reputation of the book or its authors
(especially if it involves a potential headache with Amazon) or to promote the book.
So, as an author, you do all the hard work, and your publisher just takes over your
sweat-and-blood creation, makes money from it, while you do all the work promoting
the book, with little to no support from the publisher, including protecting the book
from, e.g., being pirated on the internet, defamed, etc. Is this fair? Absolutely not!
So, we have terminated the publishing agreement and are making our work free
for everyone to download and benefit from the knowledge we have compiled in this
now-free e-book. We hope you enjoy it and thanks for reading our book and our
story, which hopefully will also be useful to other authors contemplating publishing
a book. Consider this. Without real editorial support, when you have to design the
book cover, deal with a large number of typos introduced by the typesetters, etc.,
is publishing with a big-name publisher all that different from “vanity publishing”?
Finally, I will let you read the book. Innovate. Disrupt. Spread the knowledge.

1 Introduction and Summary
A trading strategy can be defined as a set of instructions to achieve certain asset
holdings by some predefined times t1, t2, . . . , which holdings can (but need not) be
null at one or more of these times. In many cases, the main objective of a trading
strategy is to make a profit, i.e., to generate a positive return on its investment.
However, some viable trading strategies are not always outright profitable as standalone strategies. E.g., a hedging strategy can be a part of a bigger plan, which itself
can but need not be a trading strategy. Thus, an airline hedging against rising fuel
costs with commodity futures is a trading strategy, which is a risk-management step
in executing the airline’s business strategy of generating profits through its services.
In the case of trading strategies that are intended to be outright profitable as
stand-alone strategies, one may argue that the phrase “buy low, sell high” captures
their essence. However this viewpoint is somewhat superfluous and, while it applies
to trading strategies that buy and sell a single asset (e.g., a single stock), it would
exclude a whole host of viable strategies that do not work quite like that. E.g., a
trading strategy that uses a hedging sub-strategy for risk management may not always “buy low, sell high” when it comes to a particular asset in its portfolio. This is
because hedging risk – or, essentially, transferring some risk to other market participants – is not free, and often a trader will pay a premium for hedging some risks in
a trading strategy to achieve its objectives. Another example would be the so-called
statistical arbitrage, wherein the trading portfolio can consist of, e.g., thousands of
stocks and profitability is typically not achieved by buying low and selling high each
stock or even any discernable groups of stocks, but statistically, across all stocks,
with some trades making money and some losing it. It gets complicated quickly.
The purpose of these notes is to collect a variety of trading strategies in the
context of finance (as opposed to trading baseball cards, classic cars, etc.) across
essentially all (or at least most frequently encountered) asset classes. Here we deliberately use the term “asset class” somewhat loosely and include what can be referred
to as “asset sub-classes”. Thus, a narrower definition would include stocks, bonds,
cash, currencies, real estate, commodities and infrastructure. However, this definition would be too narrow for our purposes here. We also consider: derivatives such
as options and futures; exchange-traded funds (ETFs); indexes (which are usually
traded through vehicles such as ETFs and futures); volatility, which can be treated
as an asset class (and traded via, among other things, exchange-traded notes); structured assets (such as collateralized debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities);
convertible bonds (which represent a hybrid between bonds and stocks); distressed
assets (which are not a separate asset class per se, but the corresponding trading
strategies are rather distinct); cryptocurrencies; miscellaneous assets such as weather
and energy (derivatives); and also trading strategies such as tax arbitrage and global
macro (which use some assets mentioned above as tradables). Some strategies are
relatively simple and can be described in words, while many (in fact, most) require
a much more detailed mathematical description, which we provide formulaically.

It is important to bear in mind that, unlike the laws of nature (physics), which
(apparently) are set in stone and do not change in time, financial markets are manmade and change essentially continuously, and at times quite dramatically. One of
the consequences of this transiency is that trading strategies that may have worked
well for some time, may die, sometimes quite abruptly. E.g., when the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) started switching away from its human-operated “specialist” system to electronic trading beginning late 2006,5 many statistical arbitrage
strategies that were profitable for years prior to that, pretty much died overnight
as volatility increased and what used to do the trick before no longer did. Eventually the market was flooded with high frequency trading (HFT)6
strategies further
diminishing profit margins of many “good old” trading strategies and killing them.
However, technological advances gave rise to new types of trading, including
ubiquitous trading strategies based on data mining and machine learning, which
seek to identify – typically quite ephemeral – signals or trends by analyzing large
volumes of diverse types of data. Many of these trading signals are so faint that
they cannot be traded on their own, so one combines thousands, in fact, tens or
even hundreds of thousands if not millions of such signals with nontrivial weights
to amplify and enhance the overall signal such that it becomes tradable on its own
and profitable after trading costs and slippage, including that inflicted by HFT.7
Considering the intrinsically ephemeral nature of the financial markets and trading strategies designed to make a profit therefrom, the purpose of these notes is not
to convey to the reader how to make money using any trading strategy but simply to
provide information on and give some flavor of what kind of trading strategies people have considered across a broad cross-section of asset classes and trading styles.
In light of the foregoing, we make the following DISCLAIMER: Any information or
opinions provided herein are for informational purposes only and are not intended,
and shall not be construed, as an investment, legal, tax or any other such advice,
or an offer, solicitation, recommendation or endorsement of any trading strategy,
security, product or service. For further legal disclaimers, see Appendix B hereof.
We hope these notes will be useful to academics, practitioners, students and
aspiring researchers/traders for years to come. These notes intentionally – not to
duplicate prior literature and to avoid this manuscript spanning thousands of pages –
do not contain any numeric simulations, backtests, empirical studies, etc. However,
we do provide an eclectic cornucopia of references, including those with detailed
empirical analyses. Our purpose here is to describe, in many cases in sizable detail,
various trading strategies. Also, Appendix A provides source code for illustrating
out-of-sample backtesting (see Appendix B for legalese).8 So, we hope you enjoy!

2 Options
2.1 Generalities
An option is a form of a financial derivative. It is a contract sold by the option writer
to the option holder. Typically, an option gives the option holder the right, but not
the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying security or financial asset (e.g., a share
of common stock) at an agreed-upon price (referred to as the strike price) during a
certain period of time or on a specific date (referred to as the exercise date). A buyer
pays a premium to the seller for the option. For option pricing, see, e.g., [Harrison
and Pliska, 1981], [Baxter and Rennie, 1996], [Hull, 2012], [Kakushadze, 2015a].
A European call option is a right (but not an obligation) to buy a stock at the
maturity time T for the strike price k agreed on at time t = 0. The claim for the call
option f
call(ST , k) = (ST − k)
+. Here (x)
+ = x if x > 0, and (x)
+ = 0 if x ≤ 0. By
the “claim” we mean how much the option is worth at maturity T. If the stock price
at maturity ST > k, then the option holder gains ST −k (excluding the cost paid for
the option at t = 0). If the price at maturity ST ≤ k, then there is no profit to be
made from the option as it makes no sense to exercise it if ST < k (as it is cheaper
to buy the stock in the market) and it makes no difference if ST = k – all this is
assuming no transaction costs. Similarly, a European put option is a right (but not
an obligation) to sell a stock at the maturity time T for the strike price k agreed on
at time t = 0. The claim for the put option is given by f
put(ST , k) = (k − ST )
+.
Options can be issued on a variety of underlying assets, e.g., equities (singlestock options), bonds, futures, indexes, commodities, currencies, etc. For the sake of
terminological convenience and definiteness, in the following we will frequently refer
to the underlying asset as “stock”, even though in many cases the discussion can be
readily generalized to other assets. Furthermore, there is a variety of option styles
(beyond European options – for European options, see, e.g., [Black and Scholes,
1973]), e.g., American options (that can be exercised on any trading day on or
before expiration – see, e.g., [Kim, 1990]), Bermudan options (that can be exercised
only on specified dates on or before expiration – see, e.g., [Andersen, 1999]), Canary
options (that can be exercised, say, quarterly, but not before a determined time
period, say, 1 year, has elapsed – see, e.g., [Henrard, 2006]), Asian options (whose
payoff is determined by the average underlying price over some preset time period
– see, e.g., [Rogers and Shi, 1995]), barrier options (which can be exercised only if
the underlying security’s price passes a certain level or “barrier” – see, e.g., [Haug,
2001]), other exotic options (a broad category of options that typically are complexly
structured – see, e.g., [Fabozzi, 2002]), etc. Let us also mention binary (a.k.a. allor-nothing or digital) options (that pay a preset amount, say, $1, if the underlying
security meets a predefined condition on expiration, otherwise they simply expire
without paying anything to the holder – see, e.g., [Breeden and Litzenberger, 1978]).
Some trading strategies can be built using, e.g., combinations of options. Such
trading strategies can be divided into two groups: directional and non-directional.

Directional strategies imply an expectation on the direction of the future stock price
movements. Non-directional (a.k.a. neutral) strategies are not based on the future
direction: the trader is oblivious to whether the stock price goes up or down.
Directional strategies can be divided into two subgroups: (i) bullish strategies,
where the trader profits if the stock price goes up; and (ii) bearish strategies, where
the trader profits if the stock price goes down. Non-directional strategies can be
divided into two subgroups: (a) volatility strategies that profit if the stock has large
price movements (high volatility environment); and (b) sideways strategies that
profit if the stock price remains stable (low volatility environment). Also, one can
distinguish income, capital gain, hedging strategies, etc. (see, e.g., [Cohen, 2005]).
In the remainder of this section, unless stated otherwise, all options are for the
same stock and have the same time-to-maturity (TTM). The moneyness abbreviations are: ATM = at-the-money, ITM = in-the-money, OTM = out-of-the-money.
Also: fT is the payoff at maturity T; S0 is the stock price at the time t = 0 of
entering the trade (i.e., establishing the initial position); ST is the stock price at
maturity; C is the net credit received at t = 0, and D is the net debit required at
t = 0, as applicable; H = D (for a net debit trade) or H = −C (for a net credit
trade);9 S∗up and S∗down are the higher and lower break-even (i.e., for which fT = 0)
stock prices at maturity; if there is only one break-even price, it is denoted by S∗;
Pmax is the maximum profit at maturity; Lmax is the maximum loss at maturity.
2.2 Strategy: Covered call
This strategy (a.k.a. “buy-write” strategy) amounts to buying stock and writing a
call option with a strike price K against the stock position. The trader’s outlook on
the stock price is neutral to bullish. The covered call strategy has the same payoff as
writing a put option (short/naked put).10 While maintaining the long stock position,
the trader can generate income by periodically selling OTM call options. We have:11
fT = ST − S0 − (ST − K)
+ + C = K − S0 − (K − ST )
+ + C (1)
S∗ = S0 − C (2)
Pmax = K − S0 + C (3)
Lmax = S0 − C (4)
2.3 Strategy: Covered put
This strategy (a.k.a. “sell-write” strategy) amounts to shorting stock and writing a
put option with a strike price K against the stock position. The trader’s outlook is
9 H is the net debit for all bought option premia less the net credit for all sold option premia.
10 This is related to put-call parity (see, e.g., [Stoll, 1969], [Hull, 2012]).
11 For some literature on covered call strategies, see, e.g., [Pounds, 1978], [Whaley, 2002], [Feldman and Roy, 2004], [Hill et al, 2006], [Kapadia and Szado, 2007], [Che and Fung, 2011], [Mugwagwa

2.4 Strategy: Protective put
This strategy (a.k.a. “married put” or “synthetic call”) amounts to buying stock
and an ATM or OTM put option with a strike price K ≤ S0. The trader’s outlook
is bullish. This is a hedging strategy: the put option hedges the risk of the stock
price falling. We have:13
fT = ST − S0 + (K − ST )

S∗ = S0 + D (10)
Pmax = unlimited (11)

2.5 Strategy: Protective call
This strategy (a.k.a. “married call” or “synthetic put”) amounts to shorting stock
and buying an ATM or OTM call option with a strike price K ≥ S0. The trader’s
outlook is bearish. This is a hedging strategy: the call option hedges the risk of the
stock price rising. We have:14
fT = S0 − ST + (ST − K)
+ − D = S0 − K + (K − ST )
+ − D (13)
S∗ = S0 − D (14)
Pmax = S0 − D (15)
Lmax = K − S0 + D (16)

This is a vertical spread consisting of a long position in a close to ATM call option
with a strike price K1, and a short position in an OTM call option with a higher

literature on the covered put option strategy appears to be scarce. See, e.g., [Che, 2016].

This strategy amounts to buying an ATM call option and selling an ATM put option
with a strike price K = S0. This can be a net debit or net credit trade. Typically,
|H|  S0. The trader’s outlook is bullish: this strategy mimics a long stock or
futures position; it replicates a long forward contract with the delivery price K and

2.14 Strategy: Bull call ladder
This is a vertical spread consisting of a long position in (usually) a close to ATM
call option with a strike price K1, a short position in an OTM call option with
a strike price K2, and a short position in another OTM call option with a higher
strike price K3. A bull call ladder is a bull call spread financed by selling another
OTM call option (with the strike price K3).18 This adjusts the trader’s outlook from
bullish (bull call spread) to conservatively bullish or even non-directional (with an
expectation of low volatility). We have:
fT = (ST − K1)
+ − (ST − K2)
+ − (ST − K3)

2.15 Strategy: Bull put ladder
This is a vertical spread consisting of a short position in (usually) a close to ATM
put option with a strike price K1, a long position in an OTM put option with a strike
price K2, and a long position in another OTM put option with a lower strike price
K3. A bull put ladder typically arises when a bull put spread (a bullish strategy)
goes wrong (the stock trades lower), so the trader buys another OTM put option
(with the strike price K3) to adjust the position to bearish. We have:19

This is a horizontal spread consisting of a long position in a close to ATM call option
with TTM T
0 and a short position in another call option with the same strike price
K but shorter TTM T < T0
. This is a net debit trade. The trader’s outlook is
neutral to bullish. At the expiration of the short call option (t = T), the best case
scenario is if the stock price is right at the strike price (ST = K). At t = T let V be
the value of the long call option (expiring at t = T
0
) assuming ST = K. We have:21
Pmax = V − D (73)
Lmax = D (74)
If at the expiration of the short call option the stock price Sstop−loss ≤ ST ≤ K,
where Sstop−loss is the stop-loss price below which the trader would unwind the
entire position, then the trader can write another call option with the strike price
K and TTM T1 < T0
. While maintaining the long position in the call option with

, the trader can generate income by periodically selling call options with
shorter maturities. In this regard, this strategy resembles the covered call strategy.

2.20 Strategy: Diagonal call spread
This is a diagonal spread consisting of a long position in a deep ITM call option with
a strike price K1 and TTM T
0
, and a short position in an OTM call option with a
strike price K2 and shorter TTM T < T0
. This is a net debit trade. The trader’s
outlook is bullish. At t = T let V be the value of the long call option (expiring at
t = T
0
) assuming ST = K. We have:
Pmax = V − D (77)
Lmax = D (78)
If at the expiration of the short call option the stock price Sstop−loss ≤ ST ≤ K2,
where Sstop−loss is the stop-loss price below which the trader would unwind the entire
position, then the trader can write another OTM call option with TTM T1 < T0
.
While maintaining the long position in the call option with TTM T
0
, the trader can
generate income by periodically selling OTM call options with shorter maturities. In
this regard, this strategy is similar to the calendar call spread. The main difference
is that, in the diagonal call spread the deep ITM call option (unlike the close to
ATM call option in the calendar call spread) more closely mimics the underlying
stock, so the position is more protected against a sharp rise in the stock price.
2.21 Strategy: Diagonal put spread
This is a diagonal spread consisting of a long position in a deep ITM put option with
a strike price K1 and TTM T
0
, and a short position in an OTM put option with a
strike price K2 and shorter TTM T < T0
. This is a net debit trade. The trader’s
outlook is bearish. At t = T let V be the value of the long put option (expiring at
t = T
0
) assuming ST = K. We have:
Pmax = V − D (79)
Lmax = D (80)
If at the expiration of the short put option the stock price K2 ≤ ST ≤ Sstop−loss,
where Sstop−loss is the stop-loss price above which the trader would unwind the entire
position, then the trader can write another OTM put option with TTM T1 < T0
.

stock, so the position is more protected against a sharp drop in the stock price.
2.22 Strategy: Long straddle
This is a volatility strategy consisting of a long position in an ATM call option, and
a long position in an ATM put option with a strike price K. This is a net debit
trade. The trader’s outlook is neutral. This is a capital gain strategy. We have22:
fT = (ST − K)
+ + (K − ST )
+ − D (81)
S∗up = K + D (82)
S∗down = K − D (83)
Pmax = unlimited (84)
Lmax = D (85)
2.23 Strategy: Long strangle
This is a volatility strategy consisting of a long position in an OTM call option with
a strike price K1, and a long position in an OTM put option with a strike price K2.
This is a net debit trade. However, because both call and put options are OTM,
this strategy is less costly to establish than a long straddle position. The flipside
is that the movement in the stock price required to reach one of the break-even
points is also more significant. The trader’s outlook is neutral. This is a capital
gain strategy. We have:
fT = (ST − K1)

This is a sideways strategy consisting of a short position in an OTM call option with
a strike price K1, and a short position in an OTM put option with a strike price K2.
This is a net credit trade. Since both call and put options are OTM, this strategy
is less risky than a short straddle position. The flipside is that the initial credit is
also lower. The trader’s outlook is neutral. This is an income strategy. We have:

S∗up = K1 + C (107)
S∗down = K2 − C (108)
Pmax = C − (K2 − K1) (109)
Lmax = unlimited (110)
2.28 Strategy: Long call synthetic straddle
This volatility strategy (which is the same as a long straddle with the put replaced
by a synthetic put) amounts to shorting stock and buying two ATM (or the nearest
ITM) call options with a strike price K. The trader’s outlook is neutral. This is a
capital gain strategy.25 We have (assuming S0 ≥ K and D > S0 − K):
fT = S0 − ST + 2 × (ST − K)

S∗up = 2 × K − S0 + D (112)
S∗down = S0 − D (113)

2.29 Strategy: Long put synthetic straddle
This volatility strategy (which is the same as a long straddle with the call replaced
by a synthetic call) amounts to buying stock and buying two ATM (or the nearest
ITM) put options with a strike price K. The trader’s outlook is neutral. This is a
capital gain strategy. We have (assuming S0 ≤ K and D > K − S0):

This sideways strategy (which is the same as a short straddle with the put replaced
by a synthetic put) amounts to buying stock and selling two ATM (or the nearest

2.31 Strategy: Short put synthetic straddle
This sideways strategy (which is the same as a short straddle with the call replaced
by a synthetic call) amounts to shorting stock and selling two ATM (or the nearest
OTM) put options with a strike price K. The trader’s outlook is neutral. This is a
capital gain strategy. We have (assuming S0 ≥ K):

Pmax = S0 − K + C (129)
Lmax = unlimited (130)
2.32 Strategy: Covered short straddle
This strategy amounts to augmenting a covered call by writing a put option with
the same strike price K and TTM as the sold call option and thereby increasing the
income. The trader’s outlook is bullish. We have:

This strategy amounts to augmenting a covered call by writing an OTM put option
with a strike price K0 and the same TTM as the sold call option (whose strike price
is K) and thereby increasing the income. The trader’s outlook is bullish. We have:
fT = ST − S0 − (ST − K)

This is a volatility strategy consisting of a long position in an ATM call option, and
a long position in two ATM put options with a strike price K. This is a net debit

2.36 Strategy: Call ratio backspread
This strategy consists of a short position in NS close to ATM call options with a
strike price K1, and a long position in NL OTM call options with a strike price K2,
where NL > NS. Typically, NL = 2 and NS = 1, or NL = 3 and NS = 2. The
trader’s outlook is strongly bullish. This is a capital gain strategy. We have:27

2.37 Strategy: Put ratio backspread
This strategy consists of a short position in NS close to ATM put options with a
strike price K1, and a long position in NL OTM put options with a strike price K2,
where NL > NS. Typically, NL = 2 and NS = 1, or NL = 3 and NS = 2. The
trader’s outlook is strongly bearish. This is a capital gain strategy. We have:
fT = NL × (K2 − ST )
+ − NS × (K1 − ST )
+ − H (153)
S∗up = K1 + H/NS, H < 0 (154)
S∗down = (NL × K2 − NS × K1 − H)/(NL − NS) (155)
Pmax = NL × K2 − NS × K1 − H (156)
Lmax = NS × (K1 − K2) + H (157)
2.38 Strategy: Ratio call spread
This strategy consists of a short position in NS close to ATM call options with a
strike price K1, and a long position in NL ITM call options with a strike price K2,
where NL < NS. Typically, NL = 1 and NS = 2, or NL = 2 and NS = 3. This is
an income strategy if it is structured as a net credit trade. The trader’s outlook is
neutral to bearish. We have:28
fT = NL × (ST − K2)
+ − NS × (ST − K1)
+ − H (158)
S∗down = K2 + H/NL, H > 0 (159)
S∗up = (NS × K1 − NL × K2 − H)/(NS − NL) (160)
Pmax = NL × (K1 − K2) − H (161)
Lmax = unlimited (162)
2.39 Strategy: Ratio put spread
This strategy consists of a short position in NS close to ATM put options with a
strike price K1, and a long position in NL ITM put options with a strike price K2,
where NL < NS. Typically, NL = 1 and NS = 2, or NL = 2 and NS = 3. This is
an income strategy if it is structured as a net credit trade. The trader’s outlook is
neutral to bullish. We have:
fT = NL × (K2 − ST )
+ − NS × (K1 − ST )
+ − H (163)
S∗up = K2 − H/NL, H > 0 (164)
S∗down = (NS × K1 − NL × K2 + H)/(NS − NL) (165)
Pmax = NL × (K2 − K1) − H (166)
Lmax = NS × K1 − NL × K2 + H (167)
28 So, the difference between call/put ratio backspreads and ratio call/put spreads is that in the
former NL > NS, while in the latter NL < NS.

2.40 Strategy: Long call butterfly
This is a sideways strategy consisting of a long position in an OTM call option with
a strike price K1, a short position in two ATM call options with a strike price K2,
and a long position in an ITM call option with a strike price K3. The strikes are
equidistant: K2 − K3 = K1 − K2 = κ. This is a relatively low cost net debit trade.
The trader’s outlook is neutral. This is a capital gain strategy. We have:29
fT = (ST − K1)
+ + (ST − K3)
+ − 2 × (ST − K2)
+ − D (168)
S∗down = K3 + D (169)
S∗up = K1 − D (170)
Pmax = κ − D (171)
Lmax = D (172)
2.40.1 Strategy: Modified call butterfly
This is a variation of the long call butterfly strategy where the strikes are no longer
equidistant; instead we have K1−K2 < K2−K3. This results in a sideways strategy
with a bullish bias. We have:
fT = (ST − K1)
+ + (ST − K3)
+ − 2 × (ST − K2)
+ − D (173)
S∗ = K3 + D (174)
Pmax = K2 − K3 − D (175)
Lmax = D (176)
2.41 Strategy: Long put butterfly
This is a sideways strategy consisting of a long position in an OTM put option with
a strike price K1, a short position in two ATM put options with a strike price K2,
and a long position in an ITM put option with a strike price K3. The strikes are
equidistant: K3 − K2 = K2 − K1 = κ. This is a relatively low cost net debit trade.
The trader’s outlook is neutral. This is a capital gain strategy. We have:
fT = (K1 − ST )
+ + (K3 − ST )
+ − 2 × (K2 − ST )
+ − D (177)
S∗up = K3 − D (178)
S∗down = K1 + D (179)
Pmax = κ − D (180)
Lmax = D (181)
29 For some literature on butterfly spreads (including iron butterflies), see, e.g., [Balb´as, Longarela and Lucia, 1999], [Howison, Reisinger and Witte, 2013], [Jongadsayakul, 2017], [Matsypura
and Timkovsky, 2010], [Youbi, Pindza and Mar´e, 2017], [Wolf, 2014], [Wystup, 2017]. Academic
literature on condor strategies (which can be thought of as variations on butterflies) appears to be
more scarce. See, e.g., [Niblock, 2017].

2.41.1 Strategy: Modified put butterfly
This is a variation of the long put butterfly strategy where the strikes are no longer
equidistant; instead we have K3−K2 < K2−K1. This results in a sideways strategy
with a bullish bias. We have (for H > 0 there is also S∗up = K3 − H):30
fT = (K1 − ST )
+ + (K3 − ST )
+ − 2 × (K2 − ST )
+ − H (182)
S∗down = 2 × K2 − K3 + H (183)
Pmax = K3 − K2 − H (184)
Lmax = 2 × K2 − K1 − K3 + H (185)
2.42 Strategy: Short call butterfly
This is a volatility strategy consisting of a short position in an ITM call option with
a strike price K1, a long position in two ATM call options with a strike price K2,
and a short position in an OTM call option with a strike price K3. The strikes are
equidistant: K3 − K2 = K2 − K1 = κ. This is a net credit trade. In this sense, this
is an income strategy. However, the potential reward is sizably smaller than with a
short straddle or a short strangle (albeit with a lower risk). The trader’s outlook is
neutral. We have:
fT = 2 × (ST − K2)
+ − (ST − K1)
+ − (ST − K3)
+ + C (186)
S∗up = K3 − C (187)
S∗down = K1 + C (188)
Pmax = C (189)
Lmax = κ − C (190)
2.43 Strategy: Short put butterfly
This is a volatility strategy consisting of a short position in an ITM put option with
a strike price K1, a long position in two ATM put options with a strike price K2,
and a short position in an OTM put option with a strike price K3. The strikes are
equidistant: K2 − K3 = K1 − K2 = κ. This is a net credit trade. In this sense, this
is an income strategy. However, the potential reward is sizably smaller than with a
short straddle or a short strangle (albeit with a lower risk). The trader’s outlook is
neutral. We have:
fT = 2 × (K2 − ST )
+ − (K1 − ST )
+ − (K3 − ST )
+ + C (191)
S∗down = K3 + C (192)
S∗up = K1 − C (193)
Pmax = C (194)
Lmax = κ − C (195)
30 Ideally, this should be structured as a net credit trade, albeit this may not always be possible.

This is a sideways strategy consisting of a long position in an ITM call option with a
strike price K1, a short position in an ITM call option with a higher strike price K2,
a short position in an OTM call option with a strike price K3, and a long position
in an OTM call option with a higher strike price K4. All strikes are equidistant:
K4 − K3 = K3 − K2 = K2 − K1 = κ. This is a relatively low cost net debit trade.

a long position in an OTM call option with a strike price K3, and a short position
in an OTM call option with a higher strike price K4. All strikes are equidistant:

2.52 Strategy: Long box
This volatility strategy can be viewed as a combination of a long synthetic forward
and a short synthetic forward, or as a combination of a bull call spread and a bear
put spread, and consists of a long position in an ITM put option with a strike price
K1, a short position in an OTM put option with a lower strike price K2, a long
position in an ITM call option with the strike price K2, and a short position in an
OTM call option with the strike price K1. The trader’s outlook is neutral. This is
a capital gain strategy.31 We have (assuming K1 ≥ K2 + D):
fT = (K1 − ST )
+ − (K2 − ST )

+ − (ST − K1)
+ − D
= K1 − K2 − D (236)
Pmax = (K1 − K2) − D (237)
2.53 Strategy: Collar
This strategy (a.k.a. “fence”) is a covered call augmented by a long put option as
insurance against the stock price falling.32 It amounts to buying stock, buying an
OTM put option with a strike price K1, and selling an OTM call option with a
higher strike price K2. The trader’s outlook is moderately bullish. This is a capital
gain strategy. We have:33
fT = ST − S0 + (K1 − ST )
+ − (ST − K2)
+ − H (238)
S∗ = S0 + H (239)
Pmax = K2 − S0 − H (240)
Lmax = S0 − K1 + H (241)
2.54 Strategy: Bullish short seagull spread
This option trading strategy is a bull call spread financed with a sale of an OTM
put option. It amounts to a short position in an OTM put option with a strike
price K1, a long position in an ATM call option with a strike price K2, and a short
position in an OTM call option with a strike price K3. Ideally, the trade should be
structured to have zero cost. The trader’s outlook is bullish. This is a capital gain
31 In some cases it can be used as a tax strategy – see, e.g., [Cohen, 2005]. For some literature
on box option strategies, see, e.g., [BenZion, Anan and Yagil, 2005], [Bharadwaj and Wiggins,
2001], [Billingsley and Chance, 1985], [Clarke, de Silva and Thorley, 2013], [Fung, Mok and Wong,
2004], [Hemler and Miller, 1997], [Jongadsayakul, 2016], [Ronn and Ronn, 1989], [Vipul, 2009].
32 Similarly, a short collar is a covered put augmented by a long call option.

2.55 Strategy: Bearish long seagull spread
This option trading strategy is a short combo (short risk reversal) hedged against
the stock price rising by buying an OTM call option. It amounts to a long position
in an OTM put option with a strike price K1, a short position in an ATM call option
with a strike price K2, and a long position in an OTM call option with a strike price
K3. Ideally, the trade should be structured to have zero cost. The trader’s outlook
is bearish. This is a capital gain strategy. We have:
fT = (K1 − ST )
+ − (ST − K2)
+ + (ST − K3)
+ − H (248)
S∗ = K1 − H, H > 0 (249)
S∗ = K2 − H, H < 0 (250)
K1 ≤ S∗ ≤ K2, H = 0 (251)
Pmax = K1 − H (252)
Lmax = K3 − K2 + H (253)
2.56 Strategy: Bearish short seagull spread
This option trading strategy is a bear put spread financed with a sale of an OTM
call option. It amounts to a short position in an OTM put option with a strike
price K1, a long position in an ATM put option with a strike price K2, and a short
position in an OTM call option with a strike price K3. Ideally, the trade should be
structured to have zero cost. The trader’s outlook is bearish. This is a capital gain
strategy. We have:
fT = −(K1 − ST )
+ + (K2 − ST )
+ − (ST − K3)
+ − H (254)
S∗ = K2 − H, H > 0 (255)
S∗ = K3 − H, H < 0 (256)
K2 ≤ S∗ ≤ K3, H = 0 (257)
Pmax = K2 − K1 − H (258)
Lmax = unlimited (259)
34 Academic literature on seagull spreads appears to be scarce. For a book reference, see,
e.g., [Wystup, 2017].

3 Stocks
3.1 Strategy: Price-momentum
Empirically, there appears to be certain “inertia” in stock returns known as the
momentum effect, whereby future returns are positively correlated with past returns
(see, e.g., [Asness, 1994], [Asness et al, 2014], [Asness, Moskowitz and Pedersen,
2013], [Grinblatt and Moskowitz, 2004], [Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993]). Let t denote
time measured in the units of 1 month, with t = 0 corresponding to the most recent
time. Let Pi(t) be the time series of prices (fully adjusted for splits and dividends)
for the stock labeled by i (i = 1, . . . , N, where N is the number of stocks in the
trading universe). Let

Here: Ri(t) is the monthly return; Rcum

is the cumulative return computed over the

“skip period” (usually S = 1);35 Rmean

is the mean monthly return computed over
the formation period; R

i
is the risk-adjusted mean return over the formation
period; and σi
is the monthly volatility calculated over the formation period.
The price-momentum strategy amounts to buying the best performing stocks
and selling the worst performing stocks, where the “performance” is measured by a
selection criterion based on Rcum
i
, Rmean
i
, R

i
or some other criterion. E.g., after
the stocks are sorted by Rcum
i
(in the decreasing order), the trader can, e.g., buy
stocks in the top decile (winners) and short stocks in the bottom decile (losers).36
This can be a zero-cost strategy, i.e., the corresponding portfolio is dollar-neutral.
Alternatively, a long-only portfolio can be constructed by buying stocks in, e.g.,
the top decile. Once a portfolio is established at t = 0, it is kept unaltered during
35 Usually, the most recent month is skipped due to an empirically observed mean-reversion
(a.k.a. contrarian) effect in monthly returns possibly rooted in liquidity/microstructure issues –
see, e.g., [Asness, 1994], [Boudoukh, Richardson and Whitelaw, 1994], [Grinblatt and Moskowitz,
2004], [Jegadeesh, 1990], [Lo and MacKinlay, 1990].
36 There is some degree of arbitrariness in defining winners and losers.

a predefined “holding period”,37 which can be 1 month or longer (longer holding
period portfolios typically have diminishing returns before trading costs as the momentum effect fades with time). Multi-month-holding portfolios can be constructed
by overlapping 1-month-holding portfolios (see, e.g., [Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993]).
The above prescription does not fix the relative weights wi of the stocks in the
portfolio. For a long-only portfolio we have wi ≥ 0 and
X
N
i=1
wi = 1 (271)
So, if the total investment level is I, then the stock labeled by i has I × wi dollars
invested in it. This, up to rounding, translates into Qi = I ×wi/Pi(0) shares.38 One
can simply take uniform weights, wi = 1/N for all stocks, albeit other weighting
schemes are possible. E.g., we can have nonuniform wi ∝ 1/σi
, or wi ∝ 1/σ2
i
, etc.
For a dollar-neutral portfolio we can have negative wi and
X
N
i=1
|wi
| = 1 (272)
X
N
i=1
wi = 0 (273)
So, if the total investment level is I = IL +IS, where IL is the total long investment,
and IS is the absolute value of the total short investment,39 then the stock labeled
by i has I × wi dollars invested in it, where wi > 0 for long stocks, and wi < 0
for short stocks. One can simply take modulus-uniform weights, where wi = 1/2NL
for all NL long stocks, and wi = −1/2NS for all NS short stocks. However, other
weighting schemes are possible, e.g., as above, weights suppressed by σi
, σ
2
i
, etc.40
3.2 Strategy: Earnings-momentum
This strategy amounts to buying winners and selling losers as in the price-momentum
strategy, but the selection criterion is based on earnings. One way to define such a
37 Albeit, e.g., a long-only portfolio may have to be liquidated before the end of this holding
period due to unforeseen events, such as market crashes.
38 That is, assuming the stock is bought at the price Pi(0), which does not account for slippage.
39 For dollar-neutral portfolios IL = IS and I = 2 × IL.
40 For some additional literature on momentum strategies, see, e.g., [Antonacci, 2017], [Asem
and Tian, 2010], [Barroso and Santa-Clara, 2014], [Bhojraj and Swaminathan, 2006], [Chordia and
Shivakumar, 2002], [Chuang and Ho, 2014], [Cooper, Gutierrez and Hameed, 2004], [Daniel and
Moskowitz, 2016], [G´eczy and Samonov, 2016], [Griffin, Ji and Martin, 2003], [Grundy and Martin,
2001], [Hwang and George, 2004], [Jegadeesh and Titman, 2001], [Karolyi and Kho, 2004], [Korajczyk and Sadka, 2004], [Liu and Zhang, 2008], [Moskowitz and Grinblatt, 1999], [Rouwenhorst,

selection criterion is via standardized unexpected earnings (SUE) [Chan, Jegadeesh
and Lakonishok, 1996]:41
SUEi =
Ei − E
0
i
σi
(274)
Here: Ei
is the most recently announced quarterly earnings per share of the stock
labeled by i; E
0
i
is the earnings per share announced 4 quarters ago; σi
is the standard
deviation of the unexpected earnings Ei−E
0
i
over the last 8 quarters. Similarly to the
price-momentum strategy, the trader can, e.g., construct a dollar-neutral portfolio
by buying stocks in the top decile by SUE, and shorting stocks in the bottom decile.42
3.3 Strategy: Value
This strategy amounts to buying winners and selling losers as in the price-momentum
and earnings-momentum strategies, but the selection criterion is based on value.
Value can be defined as the Book-to-Price (B/P) ratio (see, e.g., [Rosenberg, Reid
and Lanstein, 1985]). Here “Book” is the company’s book value per share outstanding (so the B/P ratio is the same as the Book-to-Market ratio, where now “Book”
stands for its total book value, not per share outstanding, and “Market” is its market
capitalization). The trader can, e.g., construct a zero-cost portfolio by buying stocks
in the top decile by the B/P ratio, and shorting stocks in the bottom decile. There
can be variations in the definition of the B/P ratio. Thus, e.g., [Asness, Moskowitz
and Pedersen, 2013] uses current (i.e., most up-to-date) prices, while [Fama and
French, 1992] and some others use prices contemporaneous with the book value.43
3.4 Strategy: Low-volatility anomaly
This strategy is based on the empirical observation that future returns of previously
low-return-volatility portfolios outperform those of previously high-return-volatility
portfolios,44 which goes counter to the “na¨ıve” expectation that higher risk assets
41 Also see, e.g., [Bartov, Radhakrishnan and Krinsky, 2005], [Battalio and Mendenhall, 2007],
[Bernard and Thomas, 1989], [Bernard and Thomas, 1990], [Bhushan, 1994], [Chordia et al, 2009],
[Chordia and Shivakumar, 2006], [Czaja, Kaufmann and Scholz, 2013], [Doyle, Lundholm and
Soliman, 2006], [Foster, Olsen and Shevlin, 1984], [Hew et al, 1996], [Hirshleifer, Lim and Teoh,
2009], [Jansen and Nikiforov, 2016], [Livnat and Mendenhall, 2006], [Loh and Warachka, 2012],
[Mendenhall, 2004], [Ng, Rusticus and Verdi, 2008], [Rendleman, Jones and Latan´e, 1982], [Stickel,
1991], [Watts, 1978].
42 Typically, the holding period is 6 months, with diminishing returns for longer holding periods.
43 The holding period typically is 1-6 months. For some additional literature on value strategies,
see, e.g., [Erb and Harvey, 2006], [Fama and French, 1993], [Fama and French, 1996], [Fama and
French, 1998], [Fama and French, 2012], [Fisher, Shah and Titman, 2016], [Gerakos and Linnainmaa, 2012], [Novy-Marx, 2013], [Piotroski, 2000], [Piotroski and So, 2012], [Stattman, 1980], [Suhonen, Lennkh and Perez, 2017], [Zhang, 2005].
44 See, e.g., [Ang et al, 2006], [Ang et al, 2009], [Baker, Bradley and Wurgler, 2011], [Black,
1972], [Blitz and van Vliet, 2007], [Clarke, de Silva and Thorley, 2006], [Clarke, de Silva and

should yield proportionately higher returns. Thus, if σi
is defined as the historical volatility (computed over a time series of historical returns, as in Eq. (270)),
the trader can, e.g., construct a dollar-neutral portfolio by buying stocks in the
bottom decile by σi (low-volatility stocks), and shorting stocks in the top decile
(high-volatility stocks). The length of the sample used for computing the historical
volatility can, e.g., be 6 months (126 trading days) to a year (252 trading days),
with a similar duration for the holding period (with no “skip period” required).
3.5 Strategy: Implied volatility
This strategy is based on the empirical observation that stocks with larger increases
in call implied volatilities over the previous month on average have higher future returns, while stocks with larger increases in put implied volatilities over the previous
month on average have lower future returns (see, e.g., [An et al, 2014], [Chen, Chung
and Tsai, 2016]).45 Therefore, the trader can, e.g., construct a dollar-neutral portfolio by buying stocks in the top decile by the increase in call implied volatilities, and
shorting stocks in the top decile by the increase in put implied volatilities. One can
also consider variations, e.g., buying stocks in the top decile by the difference twixt
the change in call implied volatilities and the change in put implied volatilities.
3.6 Strategy: Multifactor portfolio
This strategy amounts to buying and shorting stocks based on multiple factors such
as value, momentum, etc. For instance, usually value and momentum are negatively
correlated and combining them can add value (see, e.g., [Asness, Moskowitz and
Pedersen, 2013]). There is a variety of ways in which F > 1 factors can be combined.46 The simplest way is to diversify the exposure to the F factors with some
weights wA, where A = 1, . . . , F labels the factors. That is, if I is the total investment level, then the F portfolios (each built as above based on the corresponding
factor) are allocated the investment levels IA = wA ×I, where (assuming all wA > 0)
X
F
A=1
wA = 1 (275)
Thus, one can simply take uniform weights wA = 1/F, albeit this may not be the
most optimal weighting scheme. E.g., similarly to Subsection 3.1, there are weighting
Thorley, 2010], [Frazzini and Pedersen, 2014], [Fu, 2009], [Garcia-Feij´oo et al, 2015], [Li, Sullivan
and Garcia-Feij´oo, 2014], [Li, Sullivan and Garcia-Feij´oo, 2016], [Merton, 1987].
45 Also see, e.g., [Bali and Hovakimian, 2009], [Bollen and Whaley, 2004], [Busch, Christensen
and Nielsen, 2011], [Chakravarty, Gulen and Mayhew, 2004], [Conrad, Dittmar and Ghysels, 2013],
[Cremers and Weinbaum, 2010], [Pan and Poteshman, 2006], [Xing, Zhang and Zhao, 2010].
46 And the holding period depends on which factors are combined.

schemes with wA ∝ 1/σA, wA ∝ 1/σ2
A, etc., where σA is the historical volatility for
the corresponding factor portfolio (uniformly normalized, e.g., per dollar invested).47
Alternatively, consider F rankings of stocks based on the F factors. One can
now combine these rankings in various ways to blend the factors. E.g., in the case
of two factors, momentum and value, one can take the top (winners) and bottom
(losers) quintiles by momentum and further split them into top half and bottom
half, respectively, by value. Or one can take the top and bottom quintiles by value
and split them by momentum.48 Yet another way is to define demeaned ranks
sAi = rank(fAi) −
1
N
X
N
j=1
rank(fAj ) (276)
where fAi is the numeric value of the factor labeled by A (e.g., momentum) for the
stock labeled by i (i = 1, . . . , N). One can then simply average the ranks:
si =
1
F
X
F
A=1
sAi (277)
The combined “score” si can have ties, which, if need be (e.g., if there is an ambiguity
at the border of the top decile) can be resolved, e.g., simply by giving preference to
one of the factor rankings. Averaging over sAi simply minimizes the sum of squares
of the Euclidean distances between the N-vector si and the K N-vectors sAi. One
can introduce nonuniform weights into this sum (which would amount to a weighted
average in Eq. (277)), or even use a different definition of the distance (e.g., the
Manhattan distance), which would complicate the problem computationally. Etc.49
3.7 Strategy: Residual momentum
This is the same as the price-momentum strategy with the stock returns Ri(t) replaced by the residuals i(t) of a serial regression of the stock returns Ri(t) over,
e.g., the 3 Fama-French factors MKT(t), SMB(t), HML(t),50 with the intercept (see,
47 Another approach is to fix the weights wA by optimizing a portfolio of the F expected returns
corresponding to the F factors (using an invertible F × F covariance matrix for these returns).
48 These two ways generally do not produce the same resultant portfolios.
49 For additional literature on multifactor strategies, see, e.g., [Amenc et al, 2016], [Amenc et
al, 2015], [Arnott et al, 2013], [Asness, 1997], [Barber, Bennett and Gvozdeva, 2015], [Cochrane,
1999], [Fama, 1996], [Grinold and Kahn, 2000], [Hsu, Lin and Vincent, 2018], [Kahn and Lemmon,
2015], [Kahn and Lemmon, 2016], [Kozlov and Petajisto, 2013], [Malkiel, 2014], [Wang, 2005].
50 The stock returns Ri are defined in excess of the risk-free rate (the one-month Treasury bill
rate); MKT is the excess return of the market portfolio; SMB is the excess return of the Small
minus Big (by market capitalization) portfolio; HML is the excess return of the High minus Low
(by book-to-market) portfolio. See, e.g., [Carhart, 1997], [Fama and French, 1993] for details.

e.g., [Blitz, Huij and Martens, 2011]):51
Ri(t) = αi + β1,i MKT(t) + β2,i SMB(t) + β3,i HML(t) + i(t) (278)
The regression is run over a 36-month period [Blitz, Huij and Martens, 2011] (with
the 1-month skip period) to estimate the regression coefficients αi
, β1,i, β2,i, β3,i.
Once the coefficients are estimated, the residuals can be computed for the 12-month
formation period (again, with the 1-month skip period):
i(t) = Ri(t) − β1,i MKT(t) − β2,i SMB(t) − β3,i HML(t) (279)
Note that αi
is not included in this computation of the residuals for the 12-month
formation period as αi was computed for the 36-month period. These residuals
i(t) are then used to compute, e.g., the risk-adjusted residual returns Rerisk.adj

S = 1 and T = 12; the holding period typically is 1 month, but can be longer):

E.g., a dollar-neutral portfolio can be constructed by buying stocks in the top decile

, and shorting stocks in the bottom decile (with (non)uniform weights).
3.8 Strategy: Pairs trading
This dollar-neutral strategy amounts to identifying a pair of historically highly correlated stocks (call them stock A and stock B) and, when a mispricing (i.e., a deviation
from the high historical correlation) occurs, shorting the “rich” stock and buying
the “cheap” stock. This is an example of a mean-reversion strategy. Let PA(t1) and
PB(t1) be the prices of stock A and stock B at time t1, and let PA(t2) and PB(t2)
be the prices of stock A and stock B at a later time t2. All prices are fully adjusted
for any splits and dividends. The corresponding returns (from t1 to t2) are
RA =
PA(t2)
PA(t1)
− 1 (283)
RB =
PB(t2)
PB(t1)
− 1 (284)
51 For some additional literature related to the residual momentum strategy, see, e.g., [Blitz et al,
2013], [Chang et al, 2016], [Chaves, 2012], [Chuang, 2015], [Grundy and Martin, 2001], [Gutierrez
and Prinsky, 2007], [H¨uhn and Scholz, 2017], [Huij and Lansdorp, 2017], [Van Oord, 2016].

Since typically these returns are small, we can use an alternative definition:
RA = ln 
PA(t2)
PA(t1)

(285)
RB = ln 
PB(t2)
PB(t1)

(286)
Next, let ReA and ReB be the demeaned returns:
R =
1
2
(RA + RB) (287)
ReA = RA − R (288)
ReB = RB − R (289)
where R is the mean return. A stock is “rich” if its demeaned return is positive,
and it is “cheap” if its demeaned return is negative. The numbers of shares QA, QB
to short/buy are fixed by the total desired dollar investment I (Eq. (290)) and the
requirement of dollar-neutrality (Eq. (291)):
PA |QA| + PB |QB| = I (290)
PA QA + PB QB = 0 (291)
where PA, PB are the stock prices at the time t∗ the position is established (t∗ ≥ t2).52
3.9 Strategy: Mean-reversion – single cluster
This is a generalization of the pairs trading strategy to N > 2 stocks that are
historically highly correlated (e.g., stocks belonging to the same industry or sector).

3.9.1 Strategy: Mean-reversion – multiple clusters
The mean-reversion strategy of Subsection 3.9 can be readily generalized to the case
where we have K > 1 clusters such that stocks within each cluster are historically
highly correlated.53 We can simply treat clusters independently from each other and
construct a mean-reversion strategy following the above procedure in each cluster.
Then, e.g., we can allocate investments to these K independent strategies uniformly.
There is a neat way of treating all clusters in a “unified” fashion using a linear
regression. Let the K clusters be labeled by A = 1, . . . , K. Let ΛiA be an N × K
matrix such that if the stock labeled by i (i = 1, . . . , N) belongs to the cluster
labeled by A, then ΛiA = 1; otherwise, ΛiA = 0. We will assume that each and
every stock belongs to one and only one cluster (so there are no empty clusters):
NA =
X
N
i=1
ΛiA > 0 (299)
N =
X
K
A=1
NA (300)
53 E.g., these clusters can correspond to sectors, such as energy, technology, healthcare, etc.

We have
ΛiA = δG(i),A (301)
G : {1, . . . , N} 7→ {1, . . . , K} (302)
Here: G is the map between stocks and clusters; and ΛiA is the loadings matrix.
Now consider a linear regression of the stock returns Ri over ΛiA (without the
intercept and with unit weights):
Ri =
X
K
A=1
ΛiA fA + εi (303)
where fA are the regression coefficients given by (in matrix notation, where R is the
N-vector Ri
, f is the K-vector fA, and Λ is the N × K matrix ΛiA)
f = Q
−1 Λ
T R (304)
Q = ΛT Λ (305)
and εi are the regression residuals. For binary ΛiA given by Eq. (301), these residuals
are nothing but the returns Ri demeaned w.r.t. to the corresponding cluster:
ε = R − Λ Q
−1 Λ
T R (306)
QAB = NA δAB (307)
RA =
1
NA
X
j∈JA
Rj (308)
εi = Ri − RG(i) = Rei (309)
where RA is the mean return for the cluster labeled by A, and Rei
is the demeaned
return obtained by subtracting from Ri the mean return for the cluster labeled by
A = G(i) to which the stock labeled by i belongs: JA = {i|G(i) = A} ⊂ {1, . . . , N}.
The demeaned returns are cluster-neutral, i.e.,
X
N
i=1
Rei ΛiA = 0, A = 1, . . . , K (310)
Also, note that we automatically have (so Di given by Eq. (297) satisfy Eq. (296))
X
N
i=1
Rei νi = 0 (311)
where νi ≡ 1, i = 1, . . . , N, i.e., the N-vector ν is the unit vector. In the regression
language, ν is the intercept. We did not have to add the intercept to the loadings
matrix Λ as it is already subsumed in it:

ΛiA = νi (312)

3.10 Mean-reversion – weighted regression
The conditions (310) satisfied by the demeaned returns when the loadings matrix is
binary simply mean that these returns are cluster-neutral, i.e., orthogonal to the K
N-vectors v
(A)
comprising the columns of ΛiA. Such orthogonality can be defined
for any loadings matrix, not just a binary one. So, we can consider a generalization
where the loadings matrix, call it ΩiA, may have some binary columns, but generally
it need not. The binary columns, if any, can, e.g., be industry (or sector) based risk
factors; the non-binary columns are interpreted as some non-industry based risk
factors; and the orthogonality condition
X
N
i=1
Rei ΩiA, A = 1, . . . , K (313)
can be satisfied if the twiddled returns Rei are related to the residuals εi of the
regression of Ri over ΩiA with some (generally nonuniform) regression weights zi via
Re = Z ε (314)
ε = R − Ω Q
−1 Ω
T Z R (315)
Z = diag(zi) (316)
Q = ΩT Z Ω (317)
If the intercept is included in ΩiA (i.e., a linear combination of the columns of ΩiA
equals the unit N-vector ν), then we automatically have
X
N
i=1
Rei = 0 (318)
The weights zi can, e.g., be taken as zi = 1/σ2
i
, where σi are historical volatilities.54
3.11 Strategy: Single moving average
This strategy is based on the stock price crossing a moving average. One can use
different types of moving averages (MAs), such as a simple moving average (SMA),
54 For some literature on mean-reversion (a.k.a. contrarian) strategies, see, e.g., [Avellaneda
and Lee, 2010], [Black and Litterman, 1991], [Black and Litterman, 1992], [Cheung, 2010], [Chin,
Prevost and Gottesman, 2002], [Conrad and Kaul, 1998], [Daniel, 2001], [Da Silva, Lee and Pornrojnangkool, 2009], [Doan, Alexeev and Brooks, 2014], [Drobetz, 2001], [Hodges and Carverhill,

Here: t = 1 corresponds to the most recent time in the time series of historical stock
prices P(t); T is the length of the MA (t and T are usually measured in trading
days); and λ < 1 is the factor which suppresses past contributions. Below MA will
refer to SMA or EMA. A simple strategy is defined as follows (P is the price at
t = 0, on the trading day immediately following the most recent trading day t = 1
in the time series P(t)):
Signal = (
Establish long/liquidate short position if P > MA(T)
Establish short/liquidate long position if P < MA(T)
(321)
This strategy can be run as, e.g., long-only, short-only, or both long and short. It
can be straightforwardly applied to multiple stocks (on a single-stock basis, with no
cross-sectional interaction between the signals for individual stocks). With a large
number of stocks, it may be possible to construct (near-)dollar-neutral portfolios.
3.12 Strategy: Two moving averages
The simplest variant of this strategy replaces the stock price P in Eq. (321) by
another moving average. That is, we have 2 moving averages with lengths T
0 and
T, where T
0 < T (e.g., T
0 = 10 and T = 30), and the signal is given by:
Signal = (
Establish long/liquidate short position if MA(T
0
) > MA(T)
Establish short/liquidate long position if MA(T
0
) < MA(T)
(322)
This signal can be augmented with additional “stop-loss” rules to protect realized
profits. E.g., if a long position has been established, the trader can define a threshold
55 For T  1 we have λ
T  1 and EMA(T, λ) ≈ (1 − λ) P(1) + λ EMA(T − 1, λ), where
EMA(T −1, λ) is based on P(2), P(3), . . . , P(T). Also, for some literature on moving average based
strategies, see, e.g., [BenZion et al, 2003], [Brock, Lakonishock and LeBaron, 1992], [Dzikeviˇcius and
Saranda, 2010], [Edwards and Magee, 1992], [Faber, 2007], [F´elix and Rodr´ıguez, 2008], [Fifield, ˇ

to liquidate the long position if the stock begins to fall (even if the shorter moving
average has not crossed the longer moving average yet):
Signal =



Establish long position if MA(T
0
) > MA(T)
Liquidate long position if P < (1 − ∆) × P1
Establish short position if MA(T
0
) < MA(T)
Liquidate short position if P > (1 + ∆) × P1
(323)
Here ∆ is some predefined percentage, e.g., ∆ = 2%. So, a long position is liquidated
if the current price P falls over 2% below the previous day’s price P1; and a short
position is liquidated if P rises over 2% above P1. Other variations can be used.
3.13 Strategy: Three moving averages
In some cases, using 3 moving averages with lengths T1 < T2 < T3 (e.g., T1 = 3,
T2 = 10, T3 = 21) can help filter false signals:
Signal =



Establish long position if MA(T1) > MA(T2) > MA(T3)
Liquidate long position if MA(T1) ≤ MA(T2)
Establish short position if MA(T1) < MA(T2) < MA(T3)
Liquidate short position if MA(T1) ≥ MA(T2)
(324)
3.14 Strategy: Support and resistance
This strategy uses “support” S and “resistance” R levels, which can be computed
using the “pivot point” (a.k.a. the “center”) C as follows:56
C =
PH + PL + PC
3
(325)
R = 2 × C − PL (326)
S = 2 × C − PH (327)
Here PH, PL and PC are the previous day’s high, low and closing prices. One way
to define a trading signal is as follows (as above, P is the current price):
Signal =



Establish long position if P > C
Liquidate long position if P ≥ R
Establish short position if P < C
Liquidate short position if P ≤ S
(328)
56 Other definitions of the pivot point (e.g., using the current trading day’s open price) and
higher/lower support/resistance levels exist. For some literature on support and resistance strategies, see, e.g., [Amiri et al, 2010], [Brock, Lakonishock and LeBaron, 1992], [Garzarelli et al, 2014],
[Hardy, 1978], [Kahneman and Tversky, 1979], [Murphy, 1986], [Osler, 2000], [Osler, 2003], [Person,
2007], [Pring, 1985], [Shiu and Lu, 2011], [Thomsett, 2003], [Zapranis and Tsinaslanidis, 2012].

3.15 Strategy: Channel
This strategy amounts to buying and selling a stock when it reaches the floor and
the ceiling of a channel, respectively. A channel is a range/band, bounded by a
ceiling and a floor, within which the stock price fluctuates. The trader’s expectation
may be that if the floor or the ceiling is reached, the stock price will bounce in the
opposite direction. On the other hand, if the stock price breaks through the ceiling
or the floor, the trader may conclude that a new trend has emerged and follow this
new trend instead. A simple and common definition of a channel is the Donchian
Channel [Donchian, 1960], where the ceiling Bup and the floor Bdown are defined as
follows (with the same notations as above):57
Bup = max(P(1), P(2), . . . , P(T)) (329)
Bdown = min(P(1), P(2), . . . , P(T)) (330)
A simple trading strategy then is as follows:
Signal = (
Establish long/liquidate short position if P = Bdown
Establish short/liquidate long position if P = Bup
(331)
The wider the channel, the higher the volatility. Usually, the channel indicator is
used together with other indicators. E.g., the signal can be more robust when a
price reversal (or a channel break) occurs with an increase in the traded volume.
3.16 Strategy: Event-driven – M&A
This strategy, referred to as “merger arbitrage” or “risk arbitrage”, attempts to capture excess returns generated via corporate actions such as mergers and acquisitions
(M&A). A merger arbitrage opportunity arises when one publicly traded company
intends to acquire another publicly traded company at a price that differs from the
latter’s market price. In this regard, there are two main types of transactions: cash
mergers and stock mergers. In the case of a cash merger, the trader establishes a
long position in the target company stock. In the case of a stock merger, the trader
establishes a long position in the target company stock (call it A) and a short position in the acquirer company stock (call it B). For instance, if the current price of A
is $67, the current price of B is $35, and under the proposed stock merger deal each
share of A is swapped for 2 shares of B, then the trader buys one share of A and
shorts 2 shares of B generating an initial net credit of $3 = 2 × $35 − $67, which is
the profit per each share of A bought if the deal goes through. The trader’s risk is
in that, if the deal falls through, the trader will likely lose money on this trade.58

3.17 Strategy: Machine learning – single-stock KNN
Some strategies rely on machine learning techniques, such as the k-nearest neighbor
(KNN) algorithm (see, e.g., [Altman, 1992], [Samworth, 2012]), to predict future
stock returns (the target variable) based on a set of predictor (feature) variables,
which can be based on technical, fundamental and/or some other data. The strategy
we describe here is a single-stock strategy, i.e., for each stock the target variable is
predicted using the price and volume data only for this stock (but no cross-sectional
data, i.e., no data for other stocks). The target variable Y (t) is defined as the
cumulative return over the next T trading days (as above, the ascending integer
values of t, which is measured in trading days, correspond to going back in time):
Y (t) = P(t − T)
P(t)
− 1 (332)
The predictor variables Xa(t), a = 1, . . . , m, are defined using prices P(t
0
) and
volumes V (t
0
) at times t
0 before t (i.e., t
0 > t), so they are out-of-sample. Examples
of such variables are moving averages of the price and volume of varying lengths:
X1(t) = 1
T1
X
T1
s=1
V (t + s) (333)
X2(t) = 1
T2
X
T2
s=1
P(t + s) (334)
X3(t) = 1
T3
X
T3
s=1
P(t + s) (335)
. . . (336)
The predictor variables are further normalized to lie between 0 and 1:
Xea(t) = Xa(t) − X−
a
X+
a − X−
a
(337)
where X+
a
and X−
a
are the maximum and minimum values of Xa(t) over the training
period. The final ingredient is the number k of the nearest neighbors (see below).
For a given value of t we can take k nearest neighbors of the m-vector Xea(t) among
the m-vectors Xea(t
0
), t
0 = t + 1, t + 2, . . . , t + T∗, using the KNN algorithm (here

Walkling, 2005], [Huston, 2000], [Jetley and Ji, 2010], [Karolyi and Shannon, 1999], [Khan, 2002],

Pulvino, 2001], [Officer, 2004], [Officer, 2006], [Samuelson and Rosenthal, 1986], [Subramanian,
2004], [Van Tassel, 2016], [Walkling, 1985].

T∗ is the sample size). For KNN we can use the Euclidean distance D(t, t0
) between
Xea(t) and Xea(t
0
) defined as
[D(t, t0
)]2 =
Xm
a=1
(Xea(t) − Xea(t
0
))2
(338)
However, we can use some other distance (e.g., the Manhattan distance). Let the k
nearest neighbors of Xea(t) be Xea(t
0
α
(t)), α = 1, . . . , k. (Note that the k values t
0
α
(t)
depend on t.) Then we can define the predicted value Y(t) simply as an average of
the corresponding realized values Y (t
0
α
(t)):
Y(t) = 1
k
X
k
α=1
Y (t
0
α
(t)) (339)
Alternatively, we can, e.g., consider a linear model
Y(t) = X
k
α=1
Y (t
0
α
(t)) wα + v (340)
and fix the coefficients wα and v by running a regression59 of the realized values
Y (t) over Y (t
0
α
(t)) for some number – call it M – of values of t. I.e., we pull Y (t)
for these values of t into an M-vector and regress it over the M × k matrix of the
corresponding values Y (t
0
α
(t)). The coefficients of this regression are wα and v.
The advantage of using Eq. (339) is simplicity – there are no parameters to train
in this case. We still have to backtest the strategy (see below) out-of-sample. The
disadvantage is that equally weighting contributions of all k nearest neighbors could
be suboptimal. In this regard, there are various (e.g., distance-based) weighting
schemes one may consider. Nontrivial weighting is precisely what Eq. (340) intends
to capture. However, this requires training and cross-validation (using metrics such
as root mean square error), and the fitted parameters wα and v can be (and often
are) out-of-sample unstable. The data can be split, e.g., 60% for training and 40%
for cross-validation. Ultimately, the strategy must backtest well out-of-sample.
The signal at t = 0 can be defined using the predicted value Y = Y(0), which is
the expected return for the next T days. For single-stock trading60 one can simply
define thresholds for establishing long and short trades, and liquidating existing
59 We can run this regression without the intercept, in which case we only have the coefficients
wα, or with the intercept, in which case we also have the coefficient v.
60 Alternatively, one can use expected returns Yi computed for N stocks (where N  1) using
a machine learning algorithm as above and then use these expected returns in multi-stock crosssectional strategies such as mean-reversion/statistical arbitrage.

positions, e.g., as follows:61
Signal =



Establish long position if Y > z1
Liquidate long position if Y ≤ z2
Establish short position if Y < −z1
Liquidate short position if Y ≥ −z2
(341)
Here, z1 and z2 are trader-defined thresholds. This signal must be backtested outof-sample. The number k of nearest neighbors can be optimized using a backtest
(by trying a set of values of k). Alternatively, one can use a common heuristic, e.g.,
k = floor(√
T∗) or k = ceiling(√
T∗). Also see, e.g., [Hall, Park and Samworth, 2008].
3.18 Strategy: Statistical arbitrage – optimization

portfolio.62 Let Di be the dollar holdings in our portfolio. The expected portfolio
P&L P, volatility V and Sharpe ratio S are given by
P =

N
i=1
Ei Di (342)
V
2 =
X
N
i,j=1
Cij Di Dj (343)
S = P/V (344)
Here Ei are the expected stock returns. Instead of the dollar holdings Di
, it is more
convenient to work with dimensionless holding weights (which are positive/negative
for long/short positions)
wi = Di/I (345)
61 For some literature on using machine learning for predicting stock returns, see, e.g., [Adam
and Lin, 2001], [Ang and Quek, 2006], [Chen, 2014], [Chen, Leung and Daouk, 2003], [Creamer
and Freund, 2007], [Creamer and Freund, 2010], [Gestel et al, 2001], [Grudnitski and Osborn,
1993], [Huang, Nakamori and Wang, 2005], [Huang and Tsai, 2009], [Huerta, Elkan and Corbacho,
2013], [Kablan, 2009], [Kakushadze and Yu, 2016b], [Kakushadze and Yu, 2017c], [Kakushadze
and Yu, 2018a], [Kara, Boyacioglu and Baykan, 2011], [Kim, 2003], [Kim, 2006], [Kim and Han,
2000], [Kordos and Cwiok, 2011], [Kryzanowski, Galler and Wright, 1993], [Kumar and Thenmozhi,
2001], [Liew and Mayster, 2018], [Lu, Lee and Chiu, 2009], [Milosevic, 2016], [Novak and Veluˇs¸cek,
2016], [Ou and Wang, 2009], [Refenes, Zapranis and Francis, 1994], [Rodr´ıguez-Gonz´alez et al,
2011], [Saad, Prokhorov and Wunsch, 1998], [Schumaker and Chen, 2010], [Subha and Nambi,
2012], [Tay and Cao, 2001], [Teixeira and de Oliveira, 2010], [Tsai and Hsiao, 2010], [Vanstone and
Finnie, 2009], [Yao and Tan, 2000], [Yao, Tan and Poh, 1999], [Yu, Wang and Lai, 2005].
62 The sample covariance matrix based on a time series of historical returns is singular if T ≤
N + 1, where T is the number of observations in the time series. Even if it is nonsingular, unless
T  N, which is rarely (if ever) the case, the off-diagonal elements of the sample covariance matrix
typically are unstable out-of-sample. Therefore, in practice, typically a model covariance matrix
(which is positive-definite and should be sufficiently stable out-of-sample) is used (see below).

do not correspond to a dollar-neutral portfolio. To have a dollar-neutral portfolio,
we need to maximize the Sharpe ratio subject to the dollar-neutrality constraint.
3.18.1 Dollar-neutrality
We can achieve dollar-neutrality as follows. In the absence of bounds, trading costs,
etc., the Sharpe ratio is invariant under simultaneous rescalings of all holding weights
wi → ζ wi
, where ζ > 0. Due to this scale invariance, the Sharpe ratio maximization
problem can be recast in terms of minimizing a quadratic objective function:
g(w, λ) = λ
2
X
N
i,j=1
Cij wi wj −
X
N
i=1
Ei wi (351)
g(w, λ) → min (352)
where λ > 0 is a parameter, and minimization is w.r.t. wi
. The solution is given by
wi =
1
λ

and λ is fixed via Eq. (346). The objective function approach – which is the meanvariance optimization [Markowitz, 1952] – is convenient if we wish to impose linear
homogeneous constraints (which do not spoil the aforesaid scale invariance) on wi
,
e.g., the dollar-neutrality constraint. We introduce a Lagrange multiplier µ:
63
g(w, µ, λ) = λ
2
X
N
i,j=1
Cij wi wj −
X
N
i=1
Ei wi − µ
X
N
i=1
wi (354)
g(w, µ, λ) → min (355)
Minimization w.r.t. wi and µ now gives the following equations:
λ
X
N
j=1
Cij wj = Ei + µ (356)
X
N
i=1
wi = 0 (357)
So we have dollar-neutrality. The solution to Eqs. (356) and (357) is given by:
wi =

(358)
By construction, wi satisfy the dollar-neutrality constraint (357), and λ is fixed via
Eq. (346). The expected returns Ei can be based on mean-reversion, momentum,
machine learning or other signals. Eq. (358) constructs a dollar-neutral portfolio
with “risk management” built in. E.g., the weights wi (roughly) are suppressed by
stock volatilities σi (where σ
2
i = Cii) assuming that on average |Ei
| are of order σi
.
64
The above implementation of the dollar-neutrality constraint via minimizing
the quadratic objective function (354) is equivalent to imposing this constraint
in Sharpe ratio maximization as no trading costs, position/trading bounds, nonlinear/inhomogeneous constraints, etc., are present. More generally Sharpe ratio
maximization is not equivalent to minimizing a quadratic objective function (see,
e.g., [Kakushadze, 2015b]), albeit in practice usually the latter approach is used.
63 By introducing multiple Lagrange multipliers, we can have multiple linear homogeneous
constraints (see, e.g., [Kakushadze, 2015b]).
64 Typically, Cij is a multifactor risk model covariance matrix. For a general discussion, see,
e.g., [Grinold and Kahn, 2000]. For explicit implementations (including source code), see, e.g.,
[Kakushadze, 2015e], [Kakushadze and Yu, 2016a], [Kakushadze and Yu, 2017a]. For multifactor
models, the weights are approximately neutral w.r.t. the columns of the factor loadings matrix.
The exact neutrality is attained in the zero specific risk limit, where optimization reduces to a
weighted regression (see, e.g., [Kakushadze, 2015b]).

3.19 Strategy: Market-making
Over-simplistically, this strategy amounts to capturing the bid-ask spread for a given
stock and can be (again, over-simplistically) summarized as follows:
Rule = (
Buy at the bid
Sell at the ask
(359)
In a market where most order flow is “dumb” (or uninformed), this strategy on
average would work very well. However, in a market where most order flow is
“smart” (or informed, i.e., “toxic”), this strategy, as stated, would lose money. This
is because of adverse selection, where, precisely because most order flow is smart,
most fills at the bid (ask) would be when the market is trading through it downward
(upward), so these trades would lose money. Furthermore, most limit orders to buy
(sell) at the bid (ask) would never be filled as the price would run away from them,
i.e., increase (decrease). So, ideally, this strategy should be structured such that it
captures dumb order flow and avoids smart order flow, which is not that simple.
One approach is, at any given time, within a short time horizon, to stay on
the “right” side of the market, i.e., to have a short-horizon signal indicating the
direction of the market and place limit orders accordingly (to buy at the bid if the
signal indicates a price increase, and to sell at the ask if the signal indicates a price
decrease). If the signal were (magically) 100% correct, this would capture the dumb
order flow assuming that the orders get filled. This is a big assumption as for this
to be guaranteed, the trader would have to be #1 in the queue among many other
market participants placing limit orders at the same price point. This is where high
frequency trading comes in – it is essentially all about speed with which orders are
placed, canceled, and cancel-replaced. Infrastructure and technology are key in this.
Another possibility is to modulate the short-horizon signal with a longer-horizon
signal (which can still be an intraday signal). The longer-horizon signal typically
will have a higher cents-per-share65 than the shorter-horizon signal. Now certain
trades can be profitable even with adverse selection, because they are established
based on the longer-horizon signal. I.e., they “lose money” in the short term due to
adverse selection (as the market trades through the corresponding limit orders), but
they make money in a longer term. The market-making aspect of this is valuable
as placing a passive limit order as opposed to an aggressive market or limit order
saves money. On the other hand, in some cases, if the longer-horizon signal is strong
enough and the shorter-horizon signal is in the same direction, a passive limit order
would likely not get filled and it may make more sense to place an aggressive order.
Such aggressive order flow is not dumb but smart, as it is based on nontrivial shortand long-horizon signals with a positive expected return.66 And speed still matters.
65 “Cents-per-share” is defined as the realized P&L in cents (as opposed to dollars) divided by
the total shares traded (which includes both establishing and liquidating trades). Note that the
longer-horizon signal generally has a lower Sharpe ratio than the shorter-horizon signal.
66 Dumb order flow can come from, e.g., uninformed retail traders. It can also come from ultra58

3.20 Strategy: Alpha combos
With technological advances – hardware becoming cheaper and more powerful – it
is now possible to data mine hundreds of thousands and even millions of alphas
using machine learning methods. Here the term “alpha” – following common trader
lingo – generally means any reasonable “expected return” that one may wish to
trade on and is not necessarily the same as the “academic” alpha.67 In practice,
often the detailed information about how alphas are constructed may not even be
available, e.g., the only data available could be the position data, so “alpha” then is
a set of instructions to achieve certain stock (or some other instrument) holdings by
some times t1, t2, . . . Also, “machine learning” here refers to sophisticated methods
that go beyond single-stock methods such as those discussed in Subsection 3.17
and involve cross-sectional analyses based on price-volume as well as other types
of data (e.g., market cap, some other fundamental data such as earnings, industry
classification data, sentiment data, etc.) for a large number of stocks (typically, a
few thousand and up). 101 explicit examples of such quantitative trading alphas
are given in [Kakushadze, 2016].68 The flipside is that these ubiquitous alphas are
faint, ephemeral and cannot be traded on their own as any profit on paper would be
eaten away by trading costs. To mitigate this, one combines a large number of such
alphas and trades the so-combined “mega-alpha”. Hence “alpha combo” strategies.
This is not critical, but for definiteness let us assume that all alphas trade the
same underlying instruments, even more concretely, the same universe of (say, 2,500)
most liquid U.S. stocks. Each alpha produces desired holdings for this trading
universe. What we need is the weights with which to combine individual alphas,
whose number N can be large (in hundreds of thousands or even millions).69 Here
long-horizon institutional traders (mutual funds, pension funds, etc.), whose outlook can be months
or years and who are not concerned about a few pennies’ worth of difference in the execution price on
short horizons (i.e., this is only “short-term dumb” order flow). For a more detailed discussion, see,
e.g., [Kakushadze, 2015d], [Lo, 2008]. For some literature on high frequency trading and marketmaking, see, e.g., [Aldridge, 2013], [Anand and Venkataraman, 2016], [Avellaneda and Stoikov,
2008], [Baron et al, 2014], [Benos et al, 2017], [Benos and Sagade, 2016], [Biais and Foucault,
2014], [Biais, Foucault and Moinas, 2014], [Bowen, Hutchinson and O’Sullivan, 2010], [Bozdog et al,
2011], [Brogaard and Garriott, 2018], [Brogaard et al, 2015], [Brogaard, Hendershott and Riordan,
2014], [Budish, Cramton and Shim, 2015], [Carrion, 2013], [Carrion and Kolay, 2017], [Easley,
L´opez de Prado and O’Hara, 2011], [Easley, L´opez de Prado and O’Hara, 2012], [Egginton, Van
Ness and Van Ness, 2016], [Hagstr¨omer and Nord´en, 2013], [Hagstr¨omer, Nord´en and Zhang,
2014], [Harris and Namvar, 2016], [Hasbrouck and Saar, 2013], [Hendershott, Jones and Menkveld,
2011], [Hendershott, Jones and Menkveld, 2013], [Hendershott and Riordan, 2013], [Hirschey, 2018],
[Holden and Jacobsen, 2014], [Jarrow and Protter, 2012], [Khandani and Lo, 2011], [Kirilenko et
al, 2017], [Korajczyk and Murphy, 2017], [Kozhan and Tham, 2012], [Li et al, 2014], [Madhavan,
2012], [Menkveld, 2013], [Menkveld, 2016], [Muthuswamy et al, 2011], [O’Hara, 2015], [Pagnotta
and Philippon, 2012], [Riordan and Storkenmaier, 2012], [Van Kervel and Menkveld, 2017].
67 By “academic” alpha we mean Jensen’s alpha [Jensen, 1968] or a similar performance index.
68 This is a secretive field, so literature on this subject is very scarce. Also see, e.g., [Kakushadze
and Tulchinsky, 2016], [Tulchinsky et al, 2015].
69 Note that N here refers to the number of alphas, not the number of underlying stocks.

3.21 A few comments
We end this section with a few comments on some of the stock trading strategies discussed above. First, single-stock technical analysis strategies (i.e., those based solely
on single-stock as opposed to cross-sectional data) such as those based on moving
averages, support and resistance, channel and even single-stock KNN, are deemed
“unscientific” by many professionals and academics. On the face of it, “fundamentally” speaking (not to be confused with fundamental analysis), there is no reason
why, say, a short moving average crossing a long moving average should have any
forecasting power.72 This is not to say that moving averages are “unscientific” or
that they should not be used. After all, e.g., trend following/momentum strategies
are based on moving averages, i.e., the expected returns are computed via moving
averages. However, looking at a large cross-section of stocks brings in a statistical
element into the game. Mean-reversion is expected to work because stocks are expected to be correlated if they belong to the same industries, etc. This relates back
70 Here s = 1, . . . , T = M + 1 labels the times ts, where, as before, t1 corresponds to the most
recent time (albeit the time direction is not crucial below), and the alpha returns are Ris = Ri(ts).
Typically, the alpha returns are computed daily, from close to close.
71 Their normalization is immaterial in what follows.
72 Arguendo, the momentum effect may appear to provide a basis for such forecasting power in
some cases. However, then one could argue, e.g., that these are momentum strategies in disguise.

to fundamental analysis and – even more importantly – to the investors’ perception
of how stock prices/returns “should” behave based on the companies’ fundamentals.
However, here too it is important to keep in mind that the stock market – an imperfect man-made construct – is not governed by laws of nature the same way as, say,
the motion of planets in the solar system is governed by fundamental laws of gravity
(see, e.g., [Kakushadze, 2015d]). The markets behave the way they do because their
participants behave in certain ways, which are sometimes irrational and certainly
not always efficient. In this regard, the key difference between technical analysis
strategies and statistical arbitrage strategies is that the latter are based on certain
perceptions trickled down from longer holding horizons (fundamental analysis based
strategies) to shorter horizons (statistical arbitrage) further enhanced by statistics,
i.e., the fact that these strategies are based on a large number of stocks whose
properties are further “stratified” according to some statistical and other features.
This brings us to the second point relating to precisely these “stratifications” in
the context of statistical arbitrage. Thus, in Subsection 3.10 we can use a binary
industry classification matrix as the loadings matrix ΩiA. Such industry classifications are based on pertinent fundamental/economic data, such as companies’
products and services, revenue sources, suppliers, competitors, partners, etc. They
are essentially independent of the pricing data and, if well-built, tend to be rather
stable out-of-sample as companies seldom jump industries. However, binary classifications can also be built based purely on pricing data, via clustering algorithms
(see, e.g., [Kakushadze and Yu, 2016b]). Alternatively, the matrix ΩiA can be nonbinary and built using, say, principal components (see, e.g., [Kakushadze and Yu,
2017a]). Some of the columns of ΩiA can be based on longer-horizon style risk factors such as value, growth, size, momentum, liquidity and volatility (see, e.g., [Ang
et al, 2006], [Anson, 2013], [Asness, 1995], [Asness et al, 2001], [Asness, Porter and
Stevens, 2000], [Banz, 1981], [Basu, 1977], [Fama and French, 1992], [Fama and
French, 1993], [Haugen, 1995], [Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993], [Lakonishok, Shleifer
and Vishny, 1994], [Liew and Vassalou, 2000], [P´astor and Stambaugh, 2003], [Scholes and Williams, 1977]),73 or shorter-horizon style factors [Kakushadze, 2015c].

4.1 Strategy: Sector momentum rotation
Empirical evidence suggests that the momentum effect exists not only for individual
stocks but also for sectors and industries.74 A sector momentum rotation strategy is
73 For (il)liquidity related considerations, also see, e.g., [Amihud, 2002].
74 For some pertinent literature, see, e.g., [Cavaglia and Vadim, 2002], [Conover et al, 2008],
[Doeswijk and Vliet, 2011], [Dolvin and Kirby, 2011], [Gao and Ren, 2015], [Hong, Torous and
Valkanov, 2007], [Levis and Liodakis, 1999], [Moskowitz and Grinblatt, 1999], [O’Neal, 2000],
[Sefton and Scowcroft, 2005], [Simpson and Grossman, 2016], [Sorensen and Burke, 1986], [Stoval,
1996], [Swinkels, 2002], [Szakmary and Zhou, 2015], [Wang et al, 2017].

based on overweighing holdings in outperforming sectors and underweighing holdings
in underperforming sectors, where the “outperformance” and “underperformance”
are based on momentum during the past T-month formation period (which typically
ranges from 6 to 12 months). ETFs concentrated in specific sectors/industries offer
a simple way to implement sector/industry rotation without having to buy or sell
a large number of underlying stocks. Similarly to Subsection 3.1, as a measure of
sector/industry momentum, we can use the corresponding ETF’s cumulative return:
R
cum
i
(t) = Pi(t)
Pi(t + T)
− 1 (361)
Here Pi(t) is the price of the ETF labeled by i. (As above, t + T is T months in the
past w.r.t. t.) Right after time t, the trader can, e.g., buy the ETFs in the top decile
by Rcum
i
(t) and hold the portfolio for a holding period (typically 1 to 3 months).
Dollar-neutral strategies can also be constructed by, e.g., buying ETFs in the top
decile and shorting ETFs in the bottom decile (as stocks, ETFs can be shorted).75
4.1.1 Strategy: Sector momentum rotation with MA filter
This is a variation/refinement of the sector momentum rotation strategy. An ETF
in the top (bottom) decile is bought (sold) only if it passes an additional filter based
on a moving average MA(T
0
) of this ETF’s price:
Rule = (
Buy top-decile ETFs only if P > MA(T
0
)
Short bottom-decile ETFs only if P < MA(T
0
)
(362)
Here P is the ETF’s price at the time of the transaction, and MA(T
0
) is computed
using daily prices (T
0
can but need not be equal T; e.g., T
0
can be 100 to 200 days).
4.1.2 Strategy: Dual-momentum sector rotation
In long-only strategies, to mitigate the risk of buying ETFs when the broad market
is trending down, relative (i.e., cross-sectional) momentum of sector ETFs can be
augmented by the absolute (i.e., time-series) momentum of, e.g., a broad market
index ETF (see, e.g., [Antonacci, 2014], [Antonacci, 2017]).76 So, a long position
based on the sector rotation signal (discussed above) is established only if the broad
75 For some literature on ETFs, see, e.g., [Agapova, 2011a], [Aldridge, 2016], [Ben-David,
Franzoni and Moussawi, 2017], [Bhattacharya et al, 2017], [Buetow and Henderson, 2012], [Clifford, Fulkerson and Jordan, 2014], [Hill, Nadig and Hougan, 2015], [Krause, Ehsani and Lien,
2014], [Madhavan, 2016], [Madura and Ngo, 2008], [Nyaradi, 2010], [Oztekin et al, 2017].
76 For some additional literature on relative momentum, absolute momentum and related topics,
see, e.g., [Ahn, Conrad and Dittmar, 2003], [Bandarchuk and Hilscher, 2013], [Berk, Green and
Naik, 1999], [Cooper, Gutierrez and Hameed, 2004], [Fama and French, 2008], [Hurst, Ooi and
Pedersen, 2017], [Johnson, 2002], [Liu and Zhang, 2008], [Moskowitz, Ooi and Pedersen, 2012], [Sagi
and Seasholes, 2007], [Schwert, 2003], [Zhang, 2006].

market index has an upward trend; otherwise, the total available funds are invested
into an ETF (e.g., gold or Treasury ETF) uncorrelated with the broad market index:
Rule = (
Buy top-decile ETFs if P > MA(T
0
)
Buy an uncorrelated ETF if P ≤ MA(T
0
)
(363)
Here P is the broad market index ETF’s price at the time of the transaction, and
MA(T
0
) is the moving average of this ETF’s price. Typically, T
0
is 100 to 200 days.
4.2 Strategy: Alpha rotation
This is the same as the sector momentum rotation strategy with the cumulative
ETF returns Rcum
i
replaced by ETF alphas αi
, which are the regression coefficients
corresponding to the intercept in a serial regression of the ETF returns77 Ri(t) over,
e.g., the 3 Fama-French factors MKT(t), SMB(t), HML(t) (see fn. 50):78
Ri(t) = αi + β1,i MKT(t) + β2,i SMB(t) + β3,i HML(t) + i(t) (364)
4.3 Strategy: R-squared
Empirical studies for mutual funds (see, e.g., [Amihud and Goyenko, 2013], [Ferson and Mo, 2016]) and ETFs (see, e.g., [Garyn-Tal, 2014a], [Garyn-Tal, 2014b])
suggest that augmenting alpha by an indicator based on R2 of a serial regression
of the returns Ri(t) over multiple factors, e.g., the 3 Fama-French factors MKT(t),
SMB(t), HML(t) plus Carhart’s momentum factor MOM(t) (see fn. 50), adds value
in forecasting future returns. Thus, from the serial regression
Ri(t) = αi + β1,i MKT(t) + β2,i SMB(t) + β3,i HML(t) + β4,i MOM(t) + i(t) (365)
we can estimate αi (the regression coefficients corresponding to the intercept) and
the regression R2
, which is defined as (“SS” stands for “sum of squares”):
R

77 Typically, the estimation period is 1 year, and Ri(t) are daily or weekly returns.
78 Alpha here is Jensen’s alpha defined for ETF returns as opposed to mutual fund returns
as in [Jensen, 1968]. For some additional literature related to Jensen’s alpha, see, e.g., [Bollen
and Busse, 2005], [Droms and Walker, 2001], [Elton, Gruber and Blake, 1996a], [Goetzmann and
Ibbotson, 1994], [Grinblatt and Titman, 1992], [Jan and Hung, 2004].

An R-squared strategy then amounts to overweighing ETFs with higher “selectivity”
(defined as 1−R2
[Amihud and Goyenko, 2013]) and underweighing ETFs with lower
“selectivity”. E.g., one can first sort ETFs into quintiles by R2
, and then sort ETFs
in each such quintile into further sub-quintiles by alpha (resulting in 25 groups of
ETFs). One can then, e.g., buy ETFs in the group corresponding to the lowest R2
quintile and its highest alpha sub-quintile and sell ETFs in the group corresponding
to the highest R2 quintile and its lowest alpha sub-quintile. Other variations are
possible. Finally, the estimation period and the returns for R2
can be the same
as in the alpha rotation strategy (see Subsection 4.2 and fn. 77). However, longer
estimation periods can be considered, especially if Ri(t) are monthly returns.79
4.4 Strategy: Mean-reversion
One way (among myriad others) to construct a mean-reversion strategy for ETFs is
to use the Internal Bar Strength (IBS) based on the previous day’s close PC, high
PH and low PL prices:80
IBS = PC − PL
PH − PL
(370)
Note that IBS ranges from 0 to 1.81 An ETF can be thought of as being “rich” if its
IBS is close to 1, and as “cheap” if its IBS is close to 0. Upon sorting a universe of
ETFs cross-sectionally by IBS, a dollar-neutral strategy can, e.g., be constructed by
selling ETFs in the top decile and buying ETFs in the bottom decile. As with stock
strategies discussed above, weights can be uniform for all long and all short ETFs,
respectively, or nonuniform, e.g., based on historical ETF volatilities. Furthermore,
mean-reversion strategies we discussed above for stocks can also be adapted to ETFs.
4.5 Strategy: Leveraged ETFs (LETFs)
A leveraged (inverse) ETF seeks to double or triple (the inverse of) the daily return of
its underlying index.82 To maintain a daily leverage of 2× or 3×, LETFs rebalance
79 Also, note that in [Amihud and Goyenko, 2013] R2
is a measure of active management of a
mutual fund. In [Garyn-Tal, 2014a], [Garyn-Tal, 2014b] R2
is applied to actively managed ETFs.

every day, which requires buying on the days when the market is up and selling
when the market is down. This can result in a negative drift in the long term, which
can be exploited by shorting both a leveraged ETF and a leveraged inverse ETF
(both with the same leverage and for the same underlying index) and investing the
proceeds into, e.g., a Treasury ETF. This strategy can have a significant downside
risk in the short term if one of the short ETF legs has a sizable positive return.
4.6 Strategy: Multi-asset trend following
One allure of ETFs is their diversification power: ETFs allow to gain exposure
to different sectors, countries, asset classes, factors, etc., by taking positions in a
relatively small number of ETFs (as opposed to taking positions in a large number
of underlying instruments, e.g., thousands of stocks). Here we focus on long-only
trend-following portfolios. One needs to determine the weight wi of each ETF.
One (but by far not the only) way to fix these weights is as follows. First, as
in the sector momentum rotation strategy, we compute cumulative returns Rcum
i
(over some period T, e.g., 6-12 months). We only take ETFs with positive Rcum
i
.
If desired, optionally, we can further filter out ETFs as in the sector momentum
rotation strategy with an MA filter, by keeping only the ETFs whose last closing
prices Pi are higher than their corresponding long-term moving averages MAi(T
0
)
(typically, the MA length T
0
is 100 to 200 days). Now, instead of taking ETFs in
the top decile by Rcum
i
(as in the sector momentum rotation strategy), we can assign
nonzero weights wi to all remaining ETFs, whose number in this context is relatively
small to begin with by design. The weights can, e.g., be assigned as follows:
wi = γ1 R
cum
i
(371)
wi = γ2 R
cum
i
/σi (372)
wi = γ3 R
cum
i
/σ2
i
(373)
Here: σi
is the historical volatility; and the overall normalization coefficients γ1, γ2, γ3
in each case are computed based on the requirement that PN
i=1 wi = 1 (where N
is the number of ETFs in our portfolio after all filters are applied, i.e., those with
nonzero weights). Thus, the weights in Eq. (371) are simply proportional to the
past cumulative returns Rcum
i
, which are taken as the measure of momentum, so
the expected returns are also given by (or, more precisely, proportional to) Rcum
i
.
The issue with this weighting scheme is that it overweighs volatile ETFs as on
average Rcum
i ∝ σi
. The weights in Eq. (372) mitigate this, while the weights
in Eq. (373) actually optimize the Sharpe ratio of the ETF portfolio assuming a
diagonal covariance matrix Cij = diag(σ
2
i
) for the ETF returns, i.e., by ignoring
their correlations.83 Imposing bounds wi ≤ w
max
i
can further mitigate overweighing.

5 Fixed Income
5.1 Generalities
5.1.1 Zero-coupon bonds
A promise of being paid $1 at the maturity time T can be regarded as an asset, which
has some worth at time t before T. This asset is called a (zero-coupon) discount
bond. Let its price at time 0 ≤ t ≤ T be P(t, T). Then P(T, T) = 1. The yield of a
discount bond is defined as84
R(t, T) = −
ln(P(t, T))
T − t
(374)
and has the meaning of an average interest rate over the period of time T − t. The
higher the bond price at time t, the lower the yield R(t, T) and vice versa. Below
we refer to a zero-coupon bond with a $1 principal and maturity T as a T-bond.
5.1.2 Bonds with coupons
In practice, a bond usually pays not only its principal at maturity T, but also
makes smaller coupon payments before maturity. Consider a bond that makes n
regular coupon payments at a fixed uncompounded rate k at times Ti = T0 + iδ,
i = 1, 2, . . . , n, and also pays $1 principal at maturity T. The amount of each coupon
payment is kδ, where δ is the payment period. This income stream is equivalent to
owning one T-bond plus kδ units of each Ti-bond, i = 1, . . . , n. The price of the
coupon bond at time t then is
Pc(t, T) = P(t, T) + kδ Xn
i=I(t)
P(t, Ti) (375)
where I(t) = min(i : t < Ti). At time t = T0 we have
Pc(T0, T) = P(T0, T) + kδXn
i=1
P(T0, Ti) (376)
If we desire the coupon bond to start with its face value (Pc(T0, T) = 1), then the
corresponding coupon rate is given by
k =
1 − P(T0, T)

Pn
i=1 P(T0, Ti)

84 More precisely, this definition assumes continuous compounding. For periodic compounding
at n discrete times Ti = T0 + iδ, i = 1, . . . , n, the yield between t = T0 and t = Tn is given by
R(T0, Tn) = δ
